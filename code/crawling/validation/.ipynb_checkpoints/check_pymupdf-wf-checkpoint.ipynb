INTRODUCTION\\nWith the increasing demand for robustness and control accu-\\nracy of control systems in manufacturing, aerospace and other\\nﬁelds, adaptive control has attracted extensive attention from\\nresearchers because of its remarkable adaptability to system\\nuncertainties. So far, adaptive control has made signiﬁcant\\nprogress, with many valuable research results being reported\\n([26], [12], [10], [38], [1], [13], [3], [5], [7], [31], [18]).\\nIn recent decades, the ﬁeld of control systems has seen rapid\\nadvancements in model reference adaptive control (MRAC)\\n([10], [2], [28], [21], [40], [37]). In the traditional MRAC\\nframework, a key feature is the coupling between the unknown\\nhigh-frequency gain and the unknown estimation error asso-\\nciated with the system parameters, from which the estimation\\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation\\nof China under Grants 62322304, 61925303, 62173323, 62003277, 62088101,\\nU20B2073, in part by the Foundation under Grant 2019-JCJQ-ZD-049, and\\nin part by Beijing Institute of Technology Research Fund Program for Young\\nScholars.

To address this issue, the majority\\nof output feedback MRAC methods, such as the renowned\\naugmented error-based method ([10], [28]), choose a strategy\\nthat incorporate the high-frequency gain information. This\\ninformation is utilized to design parameter update laws and\\nprevent the singularity of MRAC laws. However, these design\\nconstraints on the high-frequency gain hinder the further\\ndevelopment of MRAC and its application in systems with\\nunknown control directions. Relaxing these design constraints\\non the high-frequency gain has consistently been a prominent\\nresearch topic in the control community.\\nFor an extended period, researchers have been dedicated to\\naddressing this problem, leading to the development of numer-\\nous enhanced adaptive control methods ([15], [24], [30], [6],\\n[11], [33], [14]). In [22], a Nussbaum function was ﬁrst intro-\\nduced into the control signal, where the prior knowledge about\\nthe high-frequency gain is no longer required. Since then,\\nthe adaptive control approaches on the basis of Nussbaum\\nfunction have been widely reported ([36], [39], [16], [9]).\\nHowever, this method may exhibit oscillation and persistent\\nswitching issues, as shown in [27], [35]. Another well-known\\nmethod to addressing the issue of high-frequency gain sign\\nis the multiple-model-based control technique, ﬁrst developed\\nin [19]. This approach has attracted signiﬁcant attention from\\nresearchers ([17], [20], [8]). The multiple-model-based control\\nmethod requires repeated estimation of plant parameters and\\nmay also exhibit the persistent switching issue, as mentioned\\nin [17]. Additionally, the design constraints on the sign of\\nthe high-frequency gain can also be removed by introducing\\nalternative design conditions, such as assuming that the bounds\\nof the high-frequency gain are known ([15]) or that the signal\\nis interval exciting ([32]).\\nReviewing the literature reveals that researchers have made\\nsigniﬁcant long-term efforts to address the high-frequency\\ngain sign problem, achieving numerous remarkable results.\\nHowever, some open issues remain unresolved. Recently, for\\ncontinuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, a modi-\\nﬁed MRAC method was developed in [23] by employing a\\nstandard Lyapunov stability analysis. This method relaxes the\\ndesign constraints on the high-frequency gain by injecting the\\nestimation of the tracking error derivative into the control sig-\\nnal, while mitigating the persistent switching issue commonly\\ninvolved in the well-known Nussbaum-based and multiple-\\nmodel-based methods. Motivated by [23], [34] proposed a\\nsingularity-free output feedback MRAC method for a general\\n\\n2\\nclass of discrete-time LTI systems, which eliminates the need\\nfor high-frequency gain sign and bound information commonly\\nused in discrete-time MRAC systems. The development of an\\noutput feedback MRAC scheme that operates independently\\nof prior knowledge concerning high-frequency gain across\\na general class of continuous-time LTI systems, particularly\\nthose with general relative degrees, presents considerable\\nchallenges. These challenges stem primarily from the need\\nto circumvent issues associated with persistent switching and\\nthe continual re-estimation of parameters. It should be em-\\nphasized that the stability analysis presented in [23] relies on\\nconventional Lyapunov techniques and is tailored speciﬁcally\\nto MRAC systems with a relative degree of one. Moreover,\\nthe control methodology delineated in [34], although effective\\nfor discrete-time systems, is ill-suited for the regulation of\\ncontinuous-time systems that exhibit general relative degrees.\\nThis incompatibility arises due to inherent differences in\\nthe stability properties between continuous and discrete-time\\nsystems. Consequently, there is a pronounced need for a\\nuniﬁed, singularity-free output feedback MRAC framework\\nthat is adaptable to continuous-time LTI systems without\\nrequiring any foreknowledge of the high-frequency gain. This\\ngap underscores a signiﬁcant and yet unexplored area within\\nthe ﬁeld of adaptive control.\\nIn this paper, we address the challenge of adaptive control\\ngain singularity in a general class of continuous-time LTI\\nsystems with general relative degrees. The fundamental strat-\\negy employed involves the decoupling of high-frequency gain\\nfrom the parameters of the derived control law. This critical\\ndecoupling enables the transformation of the estimation error\\nequation into a linear regression model, distinctively diverg-\\ning from the conventional bilinear model used in traditional\\nMRAC frameworks. Such an approach allows for the design of\\nthe parameter update law directly, eliminating the dependency\\non prior knowledge of the high-frequency gain. The signiﬁcant\\ncontributions of this research are outlined as follows:\\n(i) We develop a novel output feedback MRAC framework\\napplicable to a comprehensive range of continuous-\\ntime LTI systems with general relative degrees. The\\nproposed MRAC law is meticulously designed to ensure\\nthe boundedness of all signals within the closed-loop\\nsystem, as well as to achieve asymptotic output tracking\\nof the target plant, all accomplished without any reliance\\non prior knowledge regarding the high-frequency gain.\\n(ii) The estimation error equation is transformed into a\\nlinear regression form, facilitated by a modiﬁed MRAC\\nframework developed in this paper. This represents a\\nsigniﬁcant departure from traditional MRAC systems,\\nwhere the estimation error equation takes on a bilinear\\nregression form. The adoption of the linear regression\\nform enables direct estimation of all unknown parame-\\nters, thereby simplifying the adaptive control process.\\n(iii) A new adaptive control law with piecewise constant\\ntuning gain is proposed to address the persistent switch-\\ning and repeated parameter estimation issues, ensur-\\ning singularity-free operation. Unlike the primary ap-\\nproaches, Nussbaum and multiple-model based tech-\\nniques, which handle unknown high-frequency gains\\nthrough persistent switching and repeated parameter es-\\ntimation, the proposed solution overcomes these issues\\ndespite lacking high-frequency gain information or addi-\\ntional design conditions.\\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,\\nwe describe the controlled plant and clarify the technical issues\\nto be addressed. In Section 3, we give the design details of\\nthe proposed adaptive control scheme. In Section 4, we show\\nthe simulation results. In Section 5, we conclude the work of\\nthis paper.\\nNotation:\\nLet\\na\\nﬁnite-dimensional\\nvector\\nX(t)\\n=\\n[X1(t), ..., Xn(t)]T ∈Rn.

PROBLEM STATEMENT\\nThis section provides a description of the controlled plant\\nand outlines the technical issues that need to be addressed.\\nA. System model\\nConsider a class of LTI systems, which are characterized\\nby their input-output relationship in the following form:\\nP(s)[y](t) = kpZ(s)[u](t),\\n(1)\\nwhere this relationship holds for all t ≥0. Here, y(t) ∈R and\\nu(t) ∈R represent the output and input of the system, respec-\\ntively. The system dynamics are governed by the polynomials\\nP(s) and Z(s), deﬁned as:\\nP(s) = sn + pn−1sn−1 + · · · + p1s + p0,\\nZ(s) = sm + zm−1sm−1 + · · · + z1s + z0.\\nThe coefﬁcients pi and zj, 0 ≤i ≤n −1, 0 ≤j ≤m −1,\\nare unknown. Additionally, kp, representing an unknown non-\\nzero constant high-frequency gain, plays a crucial role in the\\nsystem’s response. The relative degree of the system, denoted\\nas n∗= n −m, can be arbitrary, such that 1 ≤n∗≤n,\\nreﬂecting the differential order between the system’s output\\nand input dynamics.\\n\\n3\\nThe reference model in our study is deﬁned by the following\\nrelationship:\\ny∗(t) = W ∗(s)[r](t),\\n(2)\\nwhere y∗(t) denotes the reference output, characterized by\\nbounded derivatives up to the n∗order. The function W ∗(s)\\nrepresents a stable transfer function, and r(t) is the reference\\ninput, which is also bounded along with its ﬁrst derivative. As\\noutlined in prior studies [10], [28], W ∗(s) is typically selected\\nas\\n1\\nRm(s) where Rm(s) is a monic Hurwitz polynomial with\\na degree equal to n∗.\\nB. Control objective and design conditions\\nThis paper is dedicated to the development of a singularity-\\nfree output feedback adaptive control law for the system\\ndescribed in (1), where all parameters, including pi, zj, and\\nkp, are assumed to be unknown. Our objective is to ensure\\nthe closed-loop stability of this system and achieve asymp-\\ntotic tracking convergence, speciﬁcally that limt→∞(y(t) −\\ny∗(t)) = 0.\\nTo advance our design and analysis, we establish the fol-\\nlowing assumptions:\\n(A1) The polynomial Z(s) is Hurwitz, ensuring that it has\\nall poles in the left half of the complex plane.\\n(A2) The degree n of the polynomial P(s) is known.\\n(A3) The system relative degree n∗is known.\\nThe closed-loop MRAC system involves zero-pole cancel-\\nlation, and Assumption (A1) ensures that this cancellation\\nis stable. Assumption (A2) determines the dimension of the\\nparameters to be estimated, while Assumption (A3) pertains\\nto the selection of W ∗(s). These assumptions represent the\\ndesign conditions required for the traditional MRAC frame-\\nwork [10], [21], [28]. Assumption (A2) can be relaxed if\\nan upper bound on n is known, and similarly, Assumption\\n(A3) can be moderated if an upper limit on n∗is established.\\nThese adaptations, as discussed in [10], [21], [28], permit a\\nmore versatile control design framework that accommodates\\nuncertainties in the system’s dynamic orders, thereby facili-\\ntating effective adaptive control performance under less rigid\\nconditions. Relaxing Assumptions (A2) and (A3) leads to\\nincreased complexity and additional computational demands.\\nDue to the scope of this paper, we do not explore the detailed\\nimplications of these relaxations.\\nC. Technical issues\\nReview of the traditional MRAC framework. To elucidate\\nthe technical issues, we provide a brief review of the traditional\\noutput feedback MRAC framework. First, we present the\\nfollowing lemma specifying the common matching equation\\nin the MRAC framework.\\nLemma 1: ([28]) Constants θ∗\\n1 ∈Rn−1, θ∗\\n2 ∈Rn−1, θ∗\\n3 ∈\\nR, θ∗\\n4 = 1/kp exist such that\\nθ∗T\\n1 b(s)P(s) +\\n\\x00θ∗T\\n2 b(s) + θ∗\\n3Ω(s)\\n\\x01\\nkpZ(s)\\n= Ω(s) (P(s) −kpθ∗\\n4Z(s)Rm(s)) ,\\n(3)\\nwhere b(s) = [1, s, . . . , sn−2]T , and Ω(s) is an any monic\\nHurwitz polynomial of degree n −1.\\nLemma 1 formulates a key identity involving these constant\\nvectors and polynomials, which plays a critical role in the sta-\\nbility and control analysis. Based on Lemma 1, the traditional\\noutput feedback MRAC law is designed as\\nu(t) = θT\\n1 (t)φ1(t)+θT\\n2 (t)φ2(t)+θ3(t)y(t)+θ4(t)r(t),\\n(4)\\nwhere θi(t), i = 1, 2, 3, 4, are estimates of θ∗\\ni , and\\nφ1(t) = b(s)\\nΩ(s)[u](t),\\nφ2(t) = b(s)\\nΩ(s)[y](t).\\n(5)\\nDeﬁne a tracking error signal e(t) = y(t) −y∗(t), and\\na signal φ(t) = [φT\\n1 (t), φT\\n2 (t), y(t), r(t)]T . Let χ(t) be an\\nestimate of kp, and θ(t) = [θT\\n1 (t), θT\\n2 (t), θ3(t), θ4(t)]T be an\\nestimate of θ∗= [θ∗T\\n1 , θ∗T\\n2 , θ∗\\n3, θ∗\\n4]T .\\nThen, to estimate the parameter θ∗, an estimation error\\nis constructed as ε(t) = e(t) + χ(t)µ(t), where µ(t) =\\nθT (t)ϕ(t) −\\n1\\nRm(s)\\n\\x02\\nθT φ\\n\\x03\\n(t) and ϕ(t) =\\n1\\nRm(s) [φ] (t). To-\\ngether with (1)-(5), ε(t) can be expressed as\\nε(t) = kp˜\\nθT (t)ϕ(t) + ˜\\nχ(t)µ(t),\\n(6)\\nwhere ˜\\nθ(t) = θ(t) −θ∗and ˜\\nχ(t) = χ(t) −kp.\\nFrom (6), the parameter update law is designed as\\n˙\\nθ(t) = −sign (kp) Γε(t)ϕ(t),\\n˙\\nχ(t) = −γε(t)µ(t),\\n(7)\\nwhere Γ ≻0, and γ > 0 is a constant.\\nThe derivations (3)-(7) represent primary designs in the\\ntraditional MRAC framework. As discussed in [10], [28], [21],\\nthe MRAC law (4) with the parameter update law (7) can\\nguarantee closed-loop stability and limt→∞(y(t)−y∗(t)) = 0.\\nClariﬁcation of the technical issues. In the conventional\\nMRAC framework, the estimation error equation (6) is char-\\nacterized by a bilinear regression form. This conﬁguration\\nresults in a coupling between the unknown high-frequency\\ngain kp and the parameter estimation error ˜\\nθ(t). Then, this\\ninterdependency complicates the direct application of standard\\nparameter update algorithms, such as gradient descent and\\nleast-squares, on the parameter estimate θ(t) when kp is\\nunknown. Additionally, maintaining the estimate of kp as a\\nnon-zero value is crucial to prevent the MRAC law (4) from\\nbecoming singular.\\nTo formulate a parameter estimate law that ensures the non-\\nsingularity of the MRAC law, most output feedback MRAC\\nmethods necessitate incorporating prior knowledge of the sign\\nof kp into the design of the parameter update law, as illustrated\\nin (7). However, this requirement for prior knowledge about kp\\nrestricts the broader applicability of the MRAC methodology,\\nparticularly in scenarios where such information may not be\\nreadily available.\\nRecently, innovative strategies to remove the design de-\\npendencies on kp were introduced in [23], [34]. Despite\\nthese advancements, as highlighted in the Introduction, these\\nmethods fall short in addressing the needs of a wide range\\nof continuous-time systems with general relative degrees. To\\n\\n4\\novercome the limitations of existing methods, particularly the\\nissues related to persistent switching and repeated parameter\\nestimation, this paper tackles several key technical challenges:\\n(i) How to develop a new output feedback MRAC law\\nthat ensures closed-loop stability and asymptotic track-\\ning performance, while eliminating the need for prior\\nknowledge of kp and any additional design conditions,\\nin contrast to the traditional MRAC framework?\\n(ii) How to ensure the non-singularity of the adaptive control\\nlaw throughout the parameter adaptation process, in order\\nto mitigate the complexities associated with persistent\\nswitching and frequent parameter re-estimation?\\n(iii) How to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the control\\nperformance in the closed-loop system, aiming to rigor-\\nously assess the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive\\ncontrol methodology?\\nIII. OUTPUT FEEDBACK MRAC DESIGN\\nIn this section, we detail the design of a novel output\\nfeedback MRAC approach tailored for the system (1).\\nA. Construction of the MRAC law\\nInspired by (4), we propose the following output feedback\\nadaptive control law:\\nu(t) =\\n1\\n1 + σρ(t)\\n\\x00θT (t)φ(t) + σθT\\np (t)φ(t)\\n\\x01\\n,\\n(8)\\nwhere ρ(t) and θp(t) serve as estimates of ρ∗and θ∗\\np,\\nrespectively, with ρ∗= kp and θ∗\\np = kpθ∗. Here, σ is\\nemployed as a piecewise constant tuning gain. Relative to the\\nconventional MRAC law (4), the designed MRAC formulation\\n(8) incorporates two novel terms: σθT\\np (t)φ(t) and σρ(t)u(t).\\nThese terms, θT\\np (t)φ(t) and ρ(t)u(t), play a pivotal role in\\nformulating the estimation error equation in a linear regression\\nmodel, which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes the parameter estimation\\nprocess. Additionally, the term σ is strategically utilized to\\nensure that the adaptive control law (8) remains singularity-\\nfree. Further details elucidating their speciﬁc contributions\\nand effects within the control strategy will be discussed\\nsubsequently. These enhancements are crucial for addressing\\nthe technical challenges previously identiﬁed.\\nB. Speciﬁcation of the new tracking error\\nOperating both sides of matching equation (3) on y(t)\\nresults in the following expression:\\nθ∗T\\n1 b(s)P(s)[y](t)+θ∗T\\n2 b(s)kpZ(s)[y](t)−Ω(s)P(s)[y](t)\\n=−θ∗\\n3Ω(s)kpZ(s)[y](t)−Ω(s)kpθ∗\\n4Z(s)Rm(s)[y](t).\\n(9)\\nGiven the stability of Ω(s) and Z(s), and substituting (1) into\\n(9), while disregarding terms that decay exponentially related\\nto initial conditions, it can be deduced that θ∗\\n4Rm(s)[y](t) =\\n−θ∗T\\n1\\nb(s)\\nΩ(s)[u](t)−θ∗T\\n2\\nb(s)\\nΩ(s)[y](t)−θ∗\\n3y(t)+u(t). Together with\\n(2) and (5), one obtains\\nRm(s)[e](t) = −θ∗T φ(t) + u(t)\\nθ∗\\n4\\n.\\n(10)\\nIt should be noted that θ∗\\n4 = 1/kp, with ρ(t) and θp(t)\\nserving as estimates for kp and kpθ∗, respectively. The control\\nlaw (8) can be reformulated as\\nu(t) = θT (t)φ(t) + σθT\\np (t)φ(t) −σρ(t)u(t)\\n= θT (t)φ(t)+σ˜\\nθT\\np (t)φ(t)−σ˜\\nρ(t)u(t)−σRm(s)[e](t).\\n(11)\\nwhere ˜\\nθp(t) = θp(t) −θ∗\\np and ˜\\nρ(t) = ρ(t) −ρ∗.\\nLet\\n¯\\nθ(t)\\nand\\nλ(t)\\nrepresent\\nestimates\\nof\\n¯\\nθ∗\\n=\\n[θ∗T , θ∗T\\np , ρ∗]T and λ∗= 1/kp, respectively. Substituting (11)\\ninto (10) yields that\\nλ∗Rm(s)[e](t) = ˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t) −σRm(s)[e](t),\\n(12)\\nwhere ˜\\n¯\\nθ(t) = ¯\\nθ(t) −¯\\nθ∗, ˜\\nλ(t) = λ(t) −λ∗and ω(t) =\\n[φT (t), σφT (t), −σu(t)]T .\\nFor parameter estimation purposes, our intention is to utilize\\nRm(s)[e](t) to construct an estimation error that facilitates\\nthe design of the parameter update law. Unfortunately, the\\nsignal Rm(s)[e](t) is not directly observable. To overcome\\nthis challenge, we introduce a newly deﬁned tracking error:\\n¯\\ne(t) = H(s)Rm(s)[e](t),\\n(13)\\nwhere H(s) is a designed stable ﬁlter, of the form\\nH(s) =\\n1\\nsn∗+ hn∗−1sn∗−1 + · · · + h1s + h0\\n(14)\\nwith hi, i = 0, 1, ..., n∗−1, being some constant parameters.\\nSince Pm(s) and H(s) have the same degree, the signal ¯\\ne(t)\\nis available.\\nOperating both sides of (12) by H(s), one has\\n(σ + λ(t)) ¯\\ne(t) = H(s)\\nh˜\\n¯\\nθT ω\\ni\\n(t) + ˜\\nλ(t)¯\\ne(t).\\n(15)\\nThen, if σ + λ(t) ̸= 0, the new tracking error (13) can be\\nexpressed as\\n¯\\ne(t) =\\n1\\nσ + λ(t)H(s)\\nh˜\\n¯\\nθT ω\\ni\\n(t) + ˜\\nλ(t)\\n¯\\ne(t)\\nσ + λ(t)\\n(16)\\nwhich is the desired tracking error equation and will be used\\nfor analyzing closed-loop system performance.\\nC. Development of the parameter update law\\nTo formulate the parameter update law in adaptive control\\nlaw (8), we introduce an estimation error signal:\\n¯\\nε(t) = ¯\\ne(t) +\\nη(t)\\nσ + λ(t),\\n(17)\\nwhere\\nη(t) = ¯\\nθT (t)ζ(t) −H(s)\\n\\x02¯\\nθT ω\\n\\x03\\n(t),\\nζ(t) = H(s) [ω] (t). (18)\\nFrom (16) and (17), an estimation error equation is derived\\nas\\n¯\\nε(t) = ˜\\nΘT (t)Φ(t),\\n(19)\\n\\n5\\nwhere\\n˜\\nΘ(t) = Θ(t) −Θ∗=\\nh˜\\n¯\\nθT (t), ˜\\nλ(t)\\niT\\n,\\nΦ(t) =\\n\\x14 ζT (t)\\nσ + λ(t),\\n¯\\ne(t)\\nσ + λ(t)\\n\\x15T\\n,\\n(20)\\nand the estimation of Θ∗=\\n\\x02¯\\nθ∗T , λ∗\\x03T is deﬁned as Θ(t).\\nNote that the derived estimation error equation (19) is in a\\nlinear regression form.\\nRemark 1: The linear conﬁguration of the estimation error\\nequation (19) is derived from the newly established MRAC\\nlaw (8). Analysis of (10) and (11) reveals that the term\\nσθT\\np (t)φ(t)−σρ(t)u(t) within the new MRAC law (8) serves\\nas an estimate of σRm(s)[e](t). This innovative estimation\\napproach effectively allows for the decoupling of the un-\\nknown high-frequency gain from the adaptive control law\\nparameters within the estimation error equation (19), resulting\\nin a formulation that adheres to a linear regression model.\\nThis transformation enhances the tractability of parameter\\nestimation within the adaptive control framework.\\n∇\\nBased on the principles of the least-squares algorithm, we\\ndevelop the following parameter update law:\\n˙\\nΘ(t) = −Υ(t)Φ(t)¯\\nε(t)\\nm2(t)\\n,\\n˙\\nΥ(t) = −Υ(t)Φ(t)ΦT (t)Υ(t)\\nm2(t)\\n,\\n(21)\\nwhere m(t) =\\np\\n1 + β1ΦT (t)Φ(t) + β2ΦT (t)Υ(t)Φ(t) with\\nβ1 and β2 being positive design parameters, and Υ(0) = Υ0 ≻\\n0 is an adaptive gain matrix.\\nRemark 2: The estimation error equation (19) constructed\\nin this paper differs signiﬁcantly from the traditional MRAC\\nframework’s estimation error equation (6), as it takes the form\\nof a linear regression. By implementing (19), the parameter\\nupdate law for Θ(t) can be directly designed. Importantly, this\\nnovel approach negates the dependency on prior knowledge\\nof the high-frequency gain kp, a staple in traditional MRAC\\nframework. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the\\nelimination of kp design constraints leads to an increase in\\nthe dimension of Θ(t), requiring careful consideration in\\nimplementation.\\n∇\\nThe features of the parameter update law are delineated in\\nthe subsequent lemma.\\nLemma 2: The parameter update law (21) ensures\\n(i) Θ(t) ∈L∞,\\n¯\\nε(t)\\nm(t) ∈L2 ∩L∞, ˙\\nΘ(t) ∈L2 ∩L∞; and\\n(ii) Θ(t) converges to a constant vector Θ∞as t →∞.\\nProof: We prove Lemma 2 via the following two steps.\\nStep 1: From Υ0 ≻0 and (21), we derive that d\\ndt(Υ−1(t))=\\n−Υ−1(t) ˙\\nΥ(t)Υ−1(t)= Φ(t)ΦT (t)\\nm2(t)\\n. It can be seen that Υ−1(t)\\nis nondecreasing. Operating both sides of the above equation\\non integral yields\\nΥ−1(t) = Υ−1\\n0\\n+\\nZ t\\n0\\nΦ(τ)ΦT (τ)\\nm2(τ)\\ndτ.\\n(22)\\nNote that Υ0 ≻0 and R t\\n0\\nΦ(τ)ΦT (τ)\\nm2(τ)\\ndτ ≥0. Then, it follows\\nthat Υ−1(t) is also positive deﬁnite for any t ≥0. Together\\nwith (21), one has that ˙\\nΥ(t) is bounded.\\nIntroduce\\na\\nLyapunov\\nfunction\\ncandidate\\nVΥ\\n=\\n˜\\nΘT (t)Υ−1(t)˜\\nΘ(t), we have\\n˙\\nVΥ = −\\n˜\\nΘT (t)Φ(t)ΦT (t)˜\\nΘ(t)\\nm2(t)\\n= −¯\\nε2(t)\\nm2(t) ≤0,\\n(23)\\nwhich implies that VΥ is convergent and bounded. Therefore,\\n¯\\nε(t)\\nm(t) ∈L2. Substituting (22) into the Lyapunov function\\ncandidate VΥ, one has\\nVΥ = ˜\\nΘT(t)Υ−1\\n0\\n˜\\nΘ(t) + ˜\\nΘT (t)\\nZ t\\n0\\nΦ(τ)ΦT (τ)\\nm2(τ)\\ndτ ˜\\nΘ(t). (24)\\nIt follows from (24), the boundedness of VΥ and the fact\\nΥ−1\\n0\\n≻0 yield that ˜\\nΘT (t)Υ−1\\n0\\n˜\\nΘ(t) ∈L∞, as well as\\n˜\\nΘ(t) ∈L∞and Θ(t) ∈L∞. Then, from (19), we deduce\\nthe boundedness of\\n¯\\nε(t)\\nm(t). Besides, based on (21), one has\\n∥˙\\nΘ(t)∥≤\\n∥Υ\\n1\\n2 (t)∥∥Υ\\n1\\n2 (t)Φ(t)∥\\nq\\n1 + β1ΦT (t)Φ(t) + β2∥Υ\\n1\\n2 (t)Φ(t)∥2\\n|¯\\nε(t)|\\nm(t) , (25)\\nwhich implies that ˙\\nΘ(t) ∈L∞. With\\n¯\\nε(t)\\nm(t) ∈L2 and (25), we\\nhave ˙\\nΘ(t) ∈L2.\\nStep 2: From Υ−1(t) ≻0 and (21), one has Υ(t) = Υ0 −\\nR t\\n0\\nΥ(τ)Φ(τ)ΦT (τ)Υ(τ)\\nm2(τ)\\ndτ ≻0. Thus, for any constant vector z\\nwith an appropriate dimension, the following formula holds\\nzTΥ(t)z = zT Υ0z −f(t) ≥0,\\n(26)\\nwhere f(t) =\\nR t\\n0\\nzT Υ(τ)Φ(τ)ΦT (τ)Υ(τ)z\\nm2(τ)\\ndτ. Further, consid-\\nering that f(t) is nondecreasing and f(t) ≤zT Υ0z, it\\nfollows from there are constants ̟1 and ̟2 ≥0 such that\\nlimt→∞f(t) = ̟1 and limt→∞zTΥ(t)z = ̟2. Then, the\\narbitrariness of the constant vector z implies Υ(t) converges\\nto some constant matrix Υ∞.\\nBased on (21), we obtain\\n˙\\n˜\\nΘ(t)\\n=\\n˙\\nΥ(t)Υ−1(t)˜\\nΘ(t)\\nwhose solution is ˜\\nΘ(t) = Υ(t)Υ−1\\n0\\n˜\\nΘ(0). Together with\\nlimt→∞Υ(t) = Υ∞, we conclude that limt→∞Θ(t) =\\nΘ∗+ limt→∞Υ(t)Υ−1\\n0\\n˜\\nΘ(0) = Θ∞.\\n□\\nD. Design of the tuning gain\\nTo guarantee the non-singularity of the adaptive control\\nlaw u(t) speciﬁed and to ensure the valid formulation of the\\ntracking error equation ¯\\ne(t) given in (16), it is crucial that\\nthe tuning gain σ is selected such that it meets the following\\nconditions for all feasible values of ρ(t) and λ(t):\\n1 + σρ(t) ̸= 0,\\n(27)\\nσ + λ(t) ̸= 0.\\n(28)\\nTo this end, the tuning gain σ is designed as\\nσ =\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\uf8f4\\n\\uf8f3\\n1\\nif ς(t) ≥1 or ρ(t) = λ(t) = 0,\\n−1\\nif ς(t) ≤−1,\\n0\\notherwise,\\n(29)\\n\\n6\\nwhere ς(t) = sign (ρ(t)) + sign (λ(t)). It is evident that the\\ntuning gain obtained from (29) ensures 1 + σρ(t) ≥1 and\\nσ + λ(t) ̸= 0, and thus (27) and (28) hold. As established\\nby Lemma 2, ρ(t) and λ(t) asymptotically converge to their\\nrespective constant values. This convergence implies that the\\ntuning gain σ necessitates only a limited number of adjust-\\nments throughout the time interval [0, ∞). Consequently, the\\nadaptive control law (8) circumvents the persistent switching\\nproblem that is often encountered in control methodologies re-\\nliant on Nussbaum functions and multiple-model approaches.\\nFurthermore, condition (29) ensures that 1/(1 + σρ(t)) ≤1,\\nsignifying that the proposed adaptive control strategy effec-\\ntively avoids issues associated with excessive gain magnitudes.\\nRemark 3: The selection of values for σ offers ﬂexibility\\nand is not constrained to a single value. Speciﬁcally, the value\\nof σ in (29) can also be chosen as any positive constant given\\nthat ς(t) ≥1 or ρ(t) = λ(t) = 0. Conversely, σ can be set\\nto any negative constant when ς(t) ≤−1. These adjustments\\nare crucial as they ensure compliance with conditions (27) and\\n(28).\\n∇\\nE. Stability analysis\\nBased on the derivations presented, the key ﬁndings of this\\npaper are outlined as follows.\\nTheorem 1: Assuming that Assumptions (A1)-(A3) are sat-\\nisﬁed for the system described in (1), the implementation\\nof the adaptive control law (8), coupled with the parameter\\nupdate law (21) and the tuning gain deﬁned in (29), guaran-\\ntees the stability of the closed-loop system and ensures that\\nlimt→∞(y(t) −y∗(t)) = 0.\\nProof: The proof consists of three steps. This proof utilizes\\nsome lemmas and notation, including Lemma 3, Lemma 4,\\nc, κ, ̺, L∞e and ∥·∥t, which are presented in Appendix A. To\\nconserve space, the exponentially decaying terms associated\\nwith initial conditions are omitted.\\nStep 1: Demonstrate that ∥ω(t)∥t ≤c∥˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)∥t + c.\\nGiven that Z(s) is a Hurwitz polynomial, the control input\\nu(t) is deﬁned as\\nu(t) = 1\\nkp\\nF(s)D(s)\\nZ(s)\\n[y](t) = 1\\nkp\\nF(s)\\nZ(s)[D(s)[y]](t),\\n(30)\\nwhere F(s)D(s) = P(s) with F(s) and D(s) as two polyno-\\nmials of degree m and n∗, respectively.

It follows from (5) and ω(t) =\\n[φT (t), σφT (t), −σu(t)]T that\\n∥ω(t)∥t ≤c∥u(t)∥t + c∥y(t)∥t + c.\\n(33)\\nThen, combining (31)-(33) yields that\\n∥u(t)∥t ≤c∥˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)∥t + c,\\n(34)\\n∥ω(t)∥t ≤c∥˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)∥t + c.\\n(35)\\nStep 2: Show that ∥d\\ndt(˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t))∥t ≤∥˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)∥t + c.\\nFrom Lemma 2 and the derivative expression:\\nd\\ndt(˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)) = ˙\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t) + ˜\\n¯\\nθT (t) ˙\\nω(t),\\n(36)\\nit follows that\\n∥d\\ndt(˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t))∥t ≤c∥ω(t)∥t + c∥˙\\nω(t)∥t + c.\\n(37)\\nTogether with (35), we have\\n∥d\\ndt(˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t))∥t ≤c∥˜\\n¯\\nθT (t)ω(t)∥t + c∥˙\\nω(t)∥t + c.\\n(38)\\nGiven the stability of\\nb(s)\\nΩ(s) and prior equations (2), (5)\\nand (8), we obtain that ∥˙\\nu(t)∥t ≤c∥φ(t)∥t + c∥˙\\nφ(t)∥t + c,\\n∥˙\\nφ(t)∥t ≤c∥u(t)∥t + c∥y(t)∥t + c∥˙\\ny(t)∥t + c∥˙\\nr(t)∥t + c and\\n∥˙\\nω(t)∥t ≤c∥˙\\nφ(t)∥t + c∥˙\\nu(t)∥t + c.

Based on (19) and (21), we have that d\\ndt( ¯\\nε(t)\\nm(t)) ∈\\nL∞.

SIMULATION EXAMPLE\\nIn this section, the proposed adaptive control scheme is\\nveriﬁed through an aircraft control system.\\nAircraft model. Consider a linearized longitudinal dynam-\\nics model of the Boeing 737 as follows [4], [29]\\nP(s)[ϑ](t) = −0.023Z(s)[δ](t), t ≥0,\\n(45)\\nwhere ϑ is the pitch angle, δ is the deviation of the elevator,\\nand the high-frequency gain is kp = −0.023. Here,\\nP(s) = s4 + 1.379s3 + 2.174s2 + 0.989s + 0.065,\\nZ(s) = s2 + 0.767s + 0.050,\\nwhere Z(s) is stable of degree two, P(s) is of order n = 4,\\nand n∗= 2 is denotes as the system relative degree of this\\nsimulation example.\\nIn this simulation, the output signal is y = ϑ and the input\\nsignal is u = δ. It’s assumed that none of the components for\\nZ(s), P(s) and kp are known. Moreover, n and n∗are known.\\nThe reference output is selected as y∗(t) =\\n1\\nRm(s)[r](t), where\\nRm(s) = s2 + 21s + 108 and r(t) = sin t −0.5 sin 0.5t.\\nControl law parameter calculation.

Here, we validate the proposed adaptive control\\nscheme through two cases. (i) The initial estimation for\\nsign(kp) is correct, and the initial value for Θ(t) is set as\\nΘ(0) = [1.2θ∗T\\n1 , 1.2θ∗T\\n2 , 1.2θ∗\\n3, 1.2θ∗\\n4, 0.9θ∗T\\np , 1.2ρ∗, 0.8λ∗]T .\\n(ii)\\nThe\\ninitial\\nestimation\\nfor\\nsign(kp)\\nis\\nwrong,\\nand\\nthe\\ninitial\\nvalue\\nfor\\nΘ(t)\\nis\\nset\\nas\\nΘ(0)\\n=\\n[0.8θ∗T\\n1 , 0.8θ∗T\\n2 , 0.8θ∗\\n3, −0.3θ∗\\n4, −0.5θ∗T\\np , −0.5ρ∗, −0.5λ∗]T .\\nSimulation responses.

Speciﬁcally, our scheme transforms the estimation\\nerror equation into a linear regression form, enabled by a\\nmodiﬁed MRAC law we developed. This is a key departure\\nfrom traditional MRAC systems, where the equation for es-\\ntimating the error takes the form of a bilinear regression.\\nThe utilizing of linear regression form simpliﬁes the adaptive\\ncontrol process, which allows for the direct estimation of\\nall unknown parameters. Meanwhile, our scheme designs a\\npiecewise constant tuning gain driven by the least-squares-\\nbased parameter update law. This tuning gain ensures that\\na modiﬁed MRAC law we developed achieves the desired\\ncontrol performance with a limited number of adjustments.\\nFinally, our scheme is applied to an aircraft control system, and\\nsimulation results demonstrate its effectiveness. Future studies\\nwill further extend the proposed adaptive control scheme to\\nmulti-input and multi-output systems and relax the design\\nconstraints on the unknown high-frequency gain matrix.\\nAPPENDIX\\nThe following section introduces two lemmas utilized in the\\nproof of Theorem 1.\\nLemma 3: ([25]) For any vectors ̟(t) ∈Rn and ξ(t) ∈Rn,\\nif Gm(s) = cm(sI −A)−1bm is the minimal realization of a\\nproper transfer function, the following equation holds\\n̟T (t)Gm(s)[ξ](t) −Gm(s)[̟T ξ](t) =\\ncm(sI −A)−1[(sI −A)−1bm[ξT ](t) ˙\\n̟](t),\\n(46)\\nwhere ˙\\n̟(t) is the ﬁrst-time derivative of ̟(t).\\nLemma 4: ([25]) Deﬁne some notation: c denotes a sig-\\nnal bound; κ and ̺ denote generic L2 ∩L∞functions\\n\\n9\\nwith ̺ asymptotically approaching zero as t →∞; ∥x∥t\\ndenotes the norm supq≤t max1≤i≤n |xi(q)| with x(t)\\n=\\n[x1(t), ..., xn(t)]T ∈Rn being a ﬁnite-dimensional vector;\\nand L∞e denotes the set {g(t) | ∀d < ∞, gd(t) ∈L∞},\\nfor any function g(t) with gd(t) = g(t), t ≤d, and otherwise,\\ngd(t) = 0.
