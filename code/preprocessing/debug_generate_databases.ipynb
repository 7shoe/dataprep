This paper presents data from an introductory course that addresses the fundamental principles of organismal biology and that incorporates several topics directly related to physics, including thermodynamics, diffusion, and fluid flow. We examine how the instructors use mathematics and physics in this introductory biology course and look at two students' responses to this use. Our preliminary observations are intended to start a discussion about the epistemological issues resulting from the integration of the science disciplines and to motivate the need for further research.INTRODUCTIONFor over a decade, researchers, policy-makers, and educators have advocated for the reform of life science education In light of these calls for reform, more research needs to be conducted to understand the implications of the i\n"
