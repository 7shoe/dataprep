      'html' : 'Abstract The fundamental relationship between the mesoscopic structure of neuronal circuits and organismic functions they subserve is one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Formation of structurally connected modules of neurons enacts the conversion from single-cell firing to large-scale behaviour of an organism, highlighting the importance of their accurate profiling in the data. While connectomes are typically characterized by significant sparsity of neuronal connections, recent advances in network theory and machine learning have revealed fundamental limitations of traditionally used community detection approaches in cases where the network is sparse. Here we studied the optimal community structure in the structural connectome of C.elegans, for which we exploited a non-conventional approach that is based on non-backtracking random walks, virtually eliminating the sparsity issue. In full agreement with the previous asymptotic results, we demonstrated that non-backtracking walks resolve the ground truth annotation into clusters on stochastic block models (SBM) with the size and density of the connectome better than the spectral methods related to simple random walks. Based on the cluster detectability threshold, we determined that the optimal number of modules in a recently mapped connectome of C.elegans is 10, which precisely corresponds to the number of isolated eigenvalues in the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. The discovered communities have a clear interpretation in terms of their functional role, which allows one to discern three structural compartments in the worm: the Worm Brain (WB), the Worm Movement Controller (WMC), and the Worm Information Flow Connector (WIFC). Broadly, our work provides a robust network-based framework to reveal mesoscopic structures in sparse connectomic datasets, paving way to further investigation of connectome mechanisms for different functions. Introduction Complexity of biological and social systems driven by collective behaviour of their agents is commonly studied using network (or graph) representation, where nodes represent agents and edges correspond to pairwise coupling between them. The resulting dimensionality reduction frequently allows to extract the most valuable information about hidden relationships governing static and dynamic properties of a system. One of the most striking and practically important examples of such information is the mesoscopic organization of the network in modules or communities. The nervous system is no exception in this regard as it can be represented as a structural connectome, that is, a graph, where vertices are nerve cells and edges reflect direct structural connections (wiring) between them. Similarly to most of real-world networks, the connectome is extremely sparse, that is, its number of theoretically possible connections between neurons greatly exceeds the factual amount of connections karrer2014percolation . Such a reduction of excessive edges is a consequence of network modularity, a tendency to form assortative communities (modules) with relatively loose inter-connections. Like an effective team work of people where complex problem requires distribution of tasks among specialized groups of participants, mesoscopic organization of neurons in a connectome serves to facilitate certain functions of the nervous system, such as ”fire together wire together” principle, hebb1949first . Thus, accurate detecting of modules (communities) in the connectome data can help to establish a conversion between micro-level single neuron interactions and macro-level organism behaviour. Community detection is an extremely hot topic in various fields such as technological albert99 ; broder00 , biological dekker13 ; ravasz02 , social redner98 ; chen09 and economical piccardi10 ; polovnikov_jphysa20 ; polovnikov_ijcai22 fields. A widely used approach in community detection is a spectral decomposition of a linear operator defined on a network: information about communities is then encoded in several leading eigenvectors Von2007tutorial ; krivelevich03 . It was shown that all commonly used matrices (adjacency, Laplacian, modularity, non-backtracking, see Methods) readily classify nodes as long as the network density is sufficient nadakuditi12 ; decelle11 . In particular, the modularity operator is one of the most efficient instruments that successfully detects communities in stochastic networks of various nature newman06 ; chen09 ; norton18 ; salespardo07 . The modularity operator can be used to extract mesoscopic organization in C.elegans pan10 . Sparse graphs are a special case where most of the traditional community detection methods suffer from fundamental limitations. Namely, at a given cluster strength there is a critical network density below which community detection becomes a very difficult problem Krzakala2013spectral . Furthermore, traditionally used operators (adjacency, Laplacian, modularity) turn out to fail above this threshold, since their leading eigenvectors rapidly become uncorrelated with the intrinsic community structure upon decrease of network density. This behaviour is explained as the emergence of vertices with anomalously high degree (hubs), which eventually perturbs the spectral edge of these operators because of the “Lifshitz tails” in the spectral density of sparse graphs (Reichardt06 ; Arenas08 ; nechaev18 ). Localization on hubs, and not on the communities, is thus a major drawback for all conventional spectral methods in the sparse regime. To address this issue, Krzakala et al. proposed Krzakala2013spectral to make use of the non-backtracking (Hashimoto) random walks on the associated directed graph. By construction, such walks cannot revisit the same node immediately at the following step and, as a result, they do not localize on hubs. The leading eigenvectors of the non-backtracking operator (the transfer matrix of non-backtracking walks) encode for the community structure of the graph up to the theoretical resolution limit Krzakala2013spectral . Due to their intrinsic ability to deal with sparse graphs, the non-backtracking walks have received increasing attention in the analysis of biological datasets. Recently we have shown that this approach allows to annotate compartments in the three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level polovnikov20 . Figure 1: Clusterization of C.elegans connectome by means of the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix: 0. A simplified scheme of the C.elegans nervous system; 1. Representation of the connectome as the adjacency matrix; 2. Construction of non-backtracking walks on the connectome network; 3. Normalization by the out-degree towards the non-backtracking flow operator; 4. The spectrum of the flow matrix (new data cook2019whole ) with the orange dots representing the eigenvalues outside of the spectral radius (pale red), which are used for identification of the communities. In this work, we examine neuronal connectivity in Caenorhabditis elegans — one of the simplest organisms with a structural connectome first mapped by White et al. in 1986 white1986structure , which has been completely described by now cook2019whole . The nervous system is a prominent part of C.elegans with almost one third of all cells in its body being neurons. Importantly, the morphology, location and connectivity of each neuron are remarkably invariant between individuals hall1991posterior (it is worth noting that there is now a growing concern on to what extent this is actually true yemini2021neuropal ; brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural ; witvliet2021connectomes ), which arguably makes this organism a convenient model for studying neuronal connectivity and related functions. Curiously, due to the elongated shape of the nervous system of the worm, the adjacency matrix of the C.elegans connectome is similar to a single-cell chromosome contact map, which describes the spatial proximity of loci in individual conformations of chromosomes nagano13 ; polovnikov20 . The so-called scaling in both types of matrices, being a generic polymer (or worm-like chain) feature, is a major source of sparsity in the data. This prompts one to apply to the C.elegans connectome the clustering procedures that has been specifically designed for reliable detection of communities in sparse networks. Here we study the mesoscopic organization of C.elegans connectome by means of the non-backtracking walks. Namely, we construct the Newman’s non-backtracking flow operator, which describes the transfer probability of a random walk on the associated directed connectome with prohibited immediate revisiting. The isolated part of the flow matrix spectrum is known to encode for communities and can be used by the clustering algorithm. We ran simulations of community detection on stochastic block models (SBMs) of the corresponding size and density as the connectome and demonstrated that the non-backtracking flow matrix outperformed all traditional operators, in the full agreement with asymptotic results of Krzakala2013spectral . In particular, we show better performance of non-backtracking walks over the modularity operator and other approaches, which were previously used for spectral clustering of the C.elegance connectome pan10 ; pavlovic2014stochastic . We consider two C.elegans connectome datasets: ”old” (Chen et al, 2006) Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and ”new” (Cook et al, 2019) cook2019whole . The difference in data completeness between these datasets is quite significant: the number of the edges has approximately doubled in the new connectome (for more details see Methods). We reveal that despite the evident difference in the network density, the modular organization of the two connectomes is rather similar, as reflected by the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. To establish the detectable amount of communities for each connectome data we propose an algorithm based on the theoretical detectability threshold for SBM-like graphs. In the new data cook2019whole our approach reveals 10 detectable communities in the C.elegans connectome, matching the number of isolated eigenvalues in the flow matrix spectrum. The biological interpretation of the communities in the complete connectome suggests that the found clusters highly correlate with the co-localization of neurites (so-called, contactome) in the nervous system of the worm, can be further associated with specific neuronal functions and also overlap with the anatomically defined ganglia. Importantly, we demonstrate that the non-backtracking clusters are much better interpretable than partitions by other spectral algorithms, as well as the modules reported previously pavlovic2014stochastic ; pan2010mesoscopic . Ultimately our integrative analysis of the mesoscopic structure of the structural connectome and related functions has revealed three neuronal compartments in the C.elegans: A. Worm Brain, B. Worm Movements Controller, C. Worm Information Flow Connector. Stochastic block model and non-backtracking random walks Here we provide a network theory background underlying clustering methods, which is instructive for the definition of the model. The particular connection with several widely used spectral clustering approaches is described in the Methods section. Stochastic block model (SBM) is a commonly used benchmark for community detection in real-world networks, with several important results obtained for asymptotically large networks decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 ; newman06 ; newman_sparse ; newman2006modularity ; Krzakala2013spectral . By definition, a SBM is a generalization of an Erdös-Renyi random graph on N nodes, where all edges are generated independently with the probability p that depends on the type of the nodes that it connects. The nodes in a graph belong to k different types (clusters), G i , i = 1 , 2 , … , k . Thus, each pair of nodes ( i , j ) : i ∈ G r , j ∈ G t gets independently connected by an edge with some probability w r \u2062 t , which can be written as a matrix of pairwise cluster probabilities W = { w r \u2062 t } with ( r , t ) = 1 , 2 , … , k . The corresponding entry in the adjacency matrix A i \u2062 j is 1 with probability w r \u2062 t and 0 otherwise. In the simplest version of the model (the planted SBM), all off-diagonal elements of the matrix W are the same and equal to w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , while all diagonal elements of W are equal to w i \u2062 n : W r \u2062 t = { w i \u2062 n , r = t w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , r ≠ t . (1) The assortative community structure corresponds to w i \u2062 n > w o \u2062 u \u2062 t . In the connectome context, the neurons belonging to the same cluster have a preferentially higher probability to be connected with a link than the neurons from different clusters. Still, some of the neurons within the same cluster in the structural connectome are not connected (clusters are not always cliques), allowing one to make use of stochastic models. Importantly, for SBMs there is a certain threshold on the minimally allowed difference Δ \u2062 w = w i \u2062 n − w o \u2062 u \u2062 t between the probabilities in order for the cluster structure to be resolved decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 . Following conventional notation, let us introduce the rescaled cluster affinities, c i \u2062 n = N \u2062 w i \u2062 n and c o \u2062 u \u2062 t = N \u2062 w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , which scale linearly with the number of the inner and outer edges of a typical community. The detectability rule suggests that the SBM clusters are asymptotically resolved ( N ≫ 1 ) as long as c i \u2062 n − c o \u2062 u \u2062 t > k \u2062 c , (2) where c = ( c i \u2062 n + c o \u2062 u \u2062 t ) / 2 is the average of c i \u2062 n , c o \u2062 u \u2062 t . For dense networks c i \u2062 n , c o \u2062 u \u2062 t , c ∼ O \u2062 ( N ) and, thus, condition (2) is satisfied at any small Δ \u2062 w > 0 . In the sparse case, c ∼ O \u2062 ( 1 ) , the threshold (2) provides a practically important condition on the parameters Δ \u2062 w and k for the cluster structure to be resolved. Spectral methods, such as Laplacian, adjacency or modularity, have been widely used to uncover the community structure in relatively dense stochastic block model networks newman_sparse ; newman2006modularity ; newman06 ; nadakuditi12 ; reluct ; Von2007tutorial . The leading non-trivial eigenvectors of the corresponding operators provide dimensionality reduction of the system and these latent coordinates are then used by some conventional clustering algorithm (such as k-means) to perform partitioning into specified number of clusters Von2007tutorial . However, as it was noted in Krzakala2013spectral , for sparse networks the leading eigenvectors become uncorrelated with true community structure above the theoretical threshold (2). This is because of the abundance of star-like sub-graphs (hubs) in a sparse network, which are identified by these operators instead of cyclic subgraphs associated with the internal structure of communities. Indeed, as these operators are related to random walks on a graph, true clusters interfere with hubs in their spectrum. As a result, it turns out that the spectral methods that exploit random-walk-related operators (such as modularity, adjacency or Laplacian) fail to find communities in rather sparse networks, despite of the network parameters satisfying the detectability condition (2). To overcome this difficulty, the spectrum of the Hashimoto matrix B can be utilized, which is a transfer matrix of non-backtracking walks on a graph. It is defined on the edges of the directed graph, i → j , k → l , as follows B i → j , k → l = { A i \u2062 j \u2062 A k \u2062 l \u2062 if \u2062 j = k \u2062 and \u2062 l ≠ i 0 \u2062 otherwise , (3) It is seen from (3) that the non-backtracking operator prohibits returns to the point which a walker visited at the previous step, thus effectively circumventing localization on the hubs. Notably, matrix B is non-symmetric and has a complex spectrum. For Poissonian graphs, the spectrum of B is constrained within a circle in the complex plane, whereas real eigenvalues of B lying out of the circle are relevant to the community structure even in sparse networks. Associating the corresponding eigenvectors with the network partitioning allows detecting communities all the way down to the theoretical limit (2). Interestingly, a ”reluctant” version of the non-backtracking operator allows exploring the hanging trees of the network reluct , which the original operator B ignores by construction. In newman_sparse the corresponding flow operator was proposed, which conserves the probability flow at each step of the non-backtracking walker (see Fig. 1): F i → j , k → l = δ j \u2062 k \u2062 ( 1 − δ l \u2062 i ) d j − 1 , (4) where d j is the degree of the vertex j . While the powers of non-backtracking matrix B count the non-backtracking walks of particular length on a graph, the flow matrix F is the transfer matrix of the non-backtracking probability. Similarly to the non-backtracking matrix, the bulk of the spectrum of F lies in the complex plane within a circle of the radius r = ⟨ d \u2062 ( d − 1 ) − 1 ⟩ ⟨ d ⟩ , (5) but, as shown in newman_sparse , has a more clear edge of the spectral band. Importantly, the amount of isolated eigenvalues in the spectrum of the flow matrix corresponds to the number of clusters in SBM network newman_sparse . In what follows, we will use the flow matrix (4) for the purpose of the connectome clustering. The flow matrix F defines the non-backtracking probability flow along the edges. While one is interested in the classification of the nodes, the eigenvectors of F have to be carefully translated from the space of edges to the space of nodes. This is conventionally performed using the relation between the quadratic forms of modularity and flow operators newman_sparse ; polovnikov20 . From this correspondence one can see that contribution u i to the i -th node of the graph comes from the in-flow along all the directed edges adjacent to i . This procedure can be formally written as follows u i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j \u2062 v j → i F (6) where v j → i F is the component of the eigenvector of the flow matrix, corresponding to the directed edge j → i . The element of the adjacency matrix A i \u2062 j is non-zero as long as there is an edge between i to j . Using (6) one can switch from edges to nodes representation of the non-backtracking flow and perform clustering of the nodes, e.g. using k-means on leading vectors u i . Trivially, isolated vertices in a graph have undefined values of the flow, and they are not involved in graph clustering.  Clustering the connectome of a worm: how many clusters are detectable? The nervous system is one of the most complex parts of the nematode C.elegans as the neurons constitute one third of all cells in this organism. The graph of the hermaphrodite connectome consists of N = 302 vertices representing neurons and C = 4887 edges (chemical synapses, see Methods) between them representing structural connections, as recorded in the new dataset cook2019whole . Since only 11 % of the theoretically possible number of edges are present in the network, one may conclude that we deal with a rather sparse network. In the old dataset, in contrast, the network density is less than 5 % , thus increasing the role of sparsity, as we will see below. In order to obtain communities in C.elegans connectome we implemented the spectral clustering approach, based on the leading non-trivial eigenvectors of the non-backtracking flow matrix (4). The spectrum of the actual network corresponding to the new data is shown in the Fig. 1. Its isolated part, which is essential for the spectral clustering, consists of the maximal (trivial) eigenvalue and 9 smaller eigenvalues that lie on the real line outside the bulk, constrained by a circle of the radius (5). This picture suggests that there are 10 communities in the network, encoded in the corresponding eigenvectors newman_sparse . As we further found, the amount of isolated eigenvalues is invariant in both datasets analysed (see Fig. S2), despite the two-fold difference in the network density. This implies the existence of a stable mesoscopic structure, as revealed by the non-backtracking spectrum. Then we asked – and this is not trivial – how many clusters out of 10 can be reliably resolved in the given data. To this end, we suggest an approach based on the detectability threshold (2). Namely, we note that for a given mean cluster strength Δ \u2062 w the condition (2) establishes the maximum number of clusters that can be resolved in the sparse network of a given size N and the average link probability w = c / N . Therefore, the critical number of clusters is related to the network parameters as follows k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = Δ \u2062 w w \u2062 N . (7) To find k m \u2062 a \u2062 x in the C.elegans connectome we cluster the network into consecutive number of clusters k = 2 , 3 , 4 , … , 10 using the eigenvectors of the non-backtracking flow matrix and determine c i \u2062 n and c o \u2062 u \u2062 t as the average amount of intra- and inter- links in the detected clusters. For each dataset we can determine the maximal amount of clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x , such that c i \u2062 n − c o \u2062 u \u2062 t is still greater than k \u2062 c (see the sketch in Fig. 2, explaining the procedure). Thus, the resulting value of k m \u2062 a \u2062 x provides the number of detectable communities, according to the detectability condition (2). An hierarchy of resulting community structures for different k is shown in Fig. 1. While the total number of isolated eigenvalues is invariant in both datasets, the detectability condition clearly suggests a strong sensitivity of the amount of resolvable clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x to the network density of the sparse experimental data (see Fig. 2). In the old and incomplete connectome data Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural only k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = 7 clusters can be resolved, thus, the remaining 3 modules cannot be established due to strong sparsity of the data. At the same time, based on the same detectability condition applied to the new connectome data cook2019whole with doubled density of synaptic connections, we conclude that all k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = 10 communities can be reliably recovered using the information from the flow matrix eigenvectors. Figure 2: Graphical representation of the condition (2) as a criterion for the optimal number of clusters that can be detected (a) in the old Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and (b) new cook2019whole connectome data. The intersection point of blue and orange curves provides the maximal amount of clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x at which the detectability condition (2) is satisfied. Non-backtracking flow outperforms other spectral methods in clustering of connectomes Having found the detectable number of modules, we next compared the performance of the non-backtracking flow matrix with traditional clustering operators, such as the normalized Laplacian and modularity matrix, on artificial networks with statistical properties similar to the experimental dataset cook2019whole . To this end, we generated a family of stochastic block models with blocks similar to the ones we have obtained in the C.elegans connectome. Namely, we fixed the network size, N = 279 , the outer-cluster probability, w o \u2062 u \u2062 t = 0.05 , and the total number of clusters, k = 7 . Furthermore, the sizes of the simulated blocks were chosen to match the sizes of the clusters in the original data. The only parameter subject to variation was the inner-cluster probability, w i \u2062 n = { 0.05 , … , 0.22 , … , 0.6 } . For each value of w i \u2062 n we generated 200 random SBMs. We ran the spectral clustering on k = 7 leading eigenvectors of four operators: non-backtracking flow, normalized Laplacian, Laplacian and modularity. The partitions predicted by the four operators were then assessed using the AMI scores, see Fig. S1. The results demonstrate distinctively better performance of the non-backtracking flow and normalized Laplacian over the modularity and Laplacian in prediction of the ground truth cluster structure of the simulated SBMs. The flow operator slightly outperformed the normalized Laplacian, especially in the region of intermediate relative cluster strengths, w i \u2062 n / w o \u2062 u \u2062 t ≈ 4 − 5 , which correspond to the empirical value. Such a moderate difference in prediction scores between the two operators is the result of a small network size N . As it was previously shown, in the limit of large (asymptotic) networks the non-backtracking operator outperforms the normalized Laplacian as well Krzakala2013spectral . Notably, the empirical value w i \u2062 n / w o \u2062 u \u2062 t ≈ 4.4 , labeled by red dots on the AMI curves, is close to the detectability limit, as in this critical region AMI abruptly decays to zero (see Fig. S1). For large N ≫ 1 there is an associated phase transition decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 , thus highlighting criticality of the worm connectome. Figure 3: Quality comparison of different spectral approaches on the new connectome data cook2019whole . (a) Q-values (15) of partitions into k clusters by various operators. (b) Partitions of the C.elegans connectome into k = 10 clusters obtained by different spectral methods. Each of the ten clusters inferred by the flow operator is annotated with a unique color according to its compartmental affiliation. (c) AMI score between ganglia and structural partitions for different number of clusters k . Next we turned to performance analysis of different clustering algorithms on the experimental network. We compute the Q-scores for each of the annotations into clusters, which is equal to the modularity score of the partition and is defined on the basis of the Newman-Girvan modularity operator (see Methods). Using this metric we reveal a better quality of non-backtracking flow clusters for various values of the total number of clusters k (see Fig. 3a). As one can infer from Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, for all k , except for k = 8 , the estimated quality of clustering by the flow operator outperforms other spectral approaches. In particular, the leading eigenvectors of the modularity matrix provide much poorer annotation into clusters, despite the quality metric being based on the modularity. This result is due to the sparsity issue discussed above; the leading spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix much better approximates the optimum of modularity function of a sparse graph than the leading spectrum of the modularity matrix itself. At the same time, we see that the normalized Laplacian produces annotations with similar, but steadily lower quality compared to the non-backtracking flow operator, in accord with the analysis of the SBM networks above (Fig. S1). Additionally, we have clustered the connectome using Infomap algorithm rosvall2009map . Interestingly, the Infomap suggests that the optimal number of clusters equals to k = 3 and provides a similar value of the modularity as obtained by the leading eigenvectors of the flow matrix ( Q ≈ 0.38 ), see Fig. 3(a). However, it fails to find all the clusters that evidently exist in the network (Fig. 2). To complement our analysis of Q-scores and better understand the (dis-)similarity of predictions by the flow matrix and other operators we further compute the pairwise relative overlaps between the clusters for the particular value of k = 10 (see Fig. S3). With the overlap threshold in 80 % we find that 5 out of 10 modularity clusters poorly correspond to the flow matrix clusters, which translates into approximately 10 % difference in the Q-scores (Fig. 3a). In the full agreement with the analysis above, only 3 clusters of normalized Laplacian overlap with the flow matrix clusters by less than 80 % . Importantly, the smallest 10th cluster of the flow operator (consisting of as few as 7 neurons) is not resolved by normalized Laplacian. It is not fully resolved by modularity operator neither: despite an apparently high overlap with a modularity cluster (consisting of 4 neurons), the modularity fails to capture the other 3 neurons of the 10th flow matrix cluster. Indeed, tiny clusters in sparse networks present a particular challenge for traditional algorithms. Additionally, we compare the structural clusters with ganglia. While ganglia represent the groups defined purely by anatomy and cannot be used as the ground truth for the structural partitions, they provide an important biological benchmark to estimate the technical noise produced by different clustering algorithms. We find that for sufficiently large number of clusters k > 4 , the AMI score for the non-backtracking flow takes the highest value compared to all other algorithms, Fig. 3c. It is also worth noting that enrichment of the edges in the new dataset cook2019whole has significantly increased the mutual information between the structural modules and the ganglia (Table S1). Still, similarity between the cluster groups obtained from old and new data is rather strong, see Fig. 4a. Furthermore, as Fig. 4b suggests, all flow matrix clusters in the new data have a statistically significant overlap with at least one ganglia ( p ≤ 10 − 3 ). As another biological benchmark, we consider partitioning of the C.elegans nervous system into six groups corresponding to different neuronal functions: motor neurons (head, body, sublateral, sex specific), sensory neurons, interneurons (see Google Spreadsheet and Fig. 4c). Noticeably, three functional types (BM, HM and SM) are located within a particular group of clusters ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ), as derived by the flow matrix; body motor neurons belong to 5th-8th clusters, head motor neurons mostly locate in the 4th cluster, sublateral motor neurons locate in the 2nd cluster. The group of interneurons belongs to the 1st and the 10th cluster (at p ≈ 10 − 3 ) and sensory neurons are spread between the 3rd, 4th and 9th clusters. Put together, the statistical analysis of clusters obtained on real and simulated connectomes suggests that the non-backtracking flow operator outperforms conventional clustering approaches on networks of size and composition similar to the C.elegans connectome. Comparison with previously reported connectome modules It is instructive to compare the results of the our algorithm (flow matrix) with other partitions reported in the literature. Here we analyse the results obtained by different approaches on the old dataset Chen2006wiring , since to the best of our knowledge there have been no attempts to cluster the new connectome data in the literature. Two open-source alternative annotations are considered, which were obtained by two different algorithms: iterative modularity maximization (IMMA) pan2010mesoscopic and Erdos-Renyi mixture model (ERMM) pavlovic2014stochastic . The IMMA approach is based on maximization of the modularity score ( k = 6 modules were found for the weighted connectome); the ERMM is a non-deterministic algorithm that fits an arbitrary, not planted, SBM network to the real connectome data ( k = 9 modules were found). First we compute the Q-scores of the clusters as obtained by the algorithms and compare to the quality of clusters produced by the flow matrix. We find that the flow matrix clusters produce a significantly higher quality of partition with the modularity value of 0.32 , which is to be compared with 0.27 and 0.19 for ERMM and IMMA clusters, respectively. Next, we compute the mutual information between partitions predicted by various methods and biological benchmarks. As Table S1 demonstrates, the IMMA algorithm yields worse agreement with the ganglia (AMI = 0.31 ) as compared to the flow matrix clusters (AMI = 0.34 ). At the same time, the ERMM approach has the same AMI score with ganglia (AMI = 0.34 ) and the mutual information between the ERMM and flow matrix clusters is sufficiently high (AMI = 0.45 ). Also both the flow matrix and ERMM algorithm grouped command interneurons from the lateral ganglion together ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) . Besides that, motor neurons were united into structural clusters by all three methods, see Fig. S5. All three methods successfully split parts of sensory neurons and interneurons, but only flow matrix was able to isolate the polymodal neurons ( p ≤ 10 − 4 ) . Overall, we conclude that the previous partitions of C.elegans connectome, based on the old dataset Chen2006wiring , display lower quality of clustering (Q-values) and worse biological interpretability than can be achieved using the leading part of the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. Figure 4: (a) Cosine similarity measure between WB, WMC and WIFC compartments for the old Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and new connectome data cook2019whole . (b) P-value of overlaps between the FM clusters and ganglia. (c) P-value of overlaps between the FM clusters and functional groups (BM – body motor neurons, HM – head motor neurons, I – interneurons, S – sensory neurons, SSM – sex specific motor neurons, SM – sublateral motor neurons). Cross-talk between the clusters is determined by neuronal programs On the basis of the complementary nature of detected communities (functional roles and anatomical locations), we reveal the following neuronal compartments. This classification is supported by similar neuronal functions and/or 3D coordinates in the worm body: the Worm Brain (1st-4th); the Worm Movement Controller (5th-8th); the Worm Information Flow Connector (9th and 10th). It should be noted that the neurons listed below are the names of the neuron sets, for example, VA contains twelve individual neurons VA1-VA12 or ADA contains ADAL and ADAR. For detailed description of cluster elements see Fig. 5. Figure 5: Three-dimensional visualization of the detected clusters in the connectome. On the basis of the complementary analysis of functional roles and anatomical locations, we identify three compartments: WB, WMC, WIFC. Original 3 D coordinates were taken from the Caltech Wormbase project harris2010wormbase . • Worm Brain (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th clusters) Similarly to the multifunctional organization of the brain of more complex organisms, we found that neurons in these four clusters had a common anatomical position and were involved in complex multimodal processes white1986structure . Based on the corresponding 3D model (see Fig 5), one can note that the 3rd and 4th clusters are closer to the nose of the worm and the 1st and 2nd clusters are located behind them. This anatomical similarity between the clusters is consistent with their close functions. Accordingly, all polymodal neurons of the head part of the worm (IL1, IL1D, IL1V, OLQD, OLQV, RIM, ASH) and sensory neurons of the anterior ganglion (IL2D, IL2, IL2V, OLL) are located in the 3rd cluster. Wherein bilaterally symmetric neurons split between these two clusters, thus 27 out of 28 neurons of the 3rd cluster are right neurons (R), while 21 out of 29 neurons of the 4th cluster are left ones (L) (see Google Spreadsheet). The majority of interneurons (ADA, RIA, RIB, RIF, RIG, RIH, RIR, RIS, RIV, URB, URX, SAAD, SAAV, AVK, SDQ, SIAD, SIAV, SIBD, SIBV) belong to the 1st and 2nd clusters. Such a ”layered” organization is consistent with intuition about how the signals received by the worm’s nervous system should be processed. • Worm Movements Controller (5th, 6th, 7th and 8th clusters) These four clusters contain the ventral cord neural group, which is split between them according to the anatomical positions of the neurons. Namely, neurons in the head half fall into the 5th and 6th clusters, while neurons in the tail body half fall into the 7th and 8th clusters (Fig. 5). Together, almost 83 % of neurons in these four clusters belong to the ventral cord (AS, DA, DB, DD, VA, VB, VC, VD, AVE), which motoneurons are located along the entire body of the worm and split exactly into two groups in accordance with which half of the body of the worm these neurons belong to: 5th and 6th clusters correspond to the head part and 7th and 8th clusters are responsible for the tail movements (bright and dark green colors Fig. 5). The remaining 17 % are represented by neurons of the tail ganglia: pre-anal ganglion, and dorsorectal ganglion (PV, LUA, PWV, PDA, PDB, DVA, DVB, DBC) and belong to the 8th cluster, which is responsible for the tail part of the ventral cord (Fig. 4b). Excitatory motor neurons in the ventral cord function as motor rhythm generators and underlie body undulation during reversal and forward movements wen2018caenorhabditis . That is why we refer this pair as a worm movements controller. The connection probabilities between these four clusters are reasonably low ( ≈ 5 % in average), which is tenable if we interpret them as disjoint parts of the movement control system, and the dense connections between motor neurons from opposite parts of the worm body are not functionally significant. • Worm Information Flow Connector (9th and 10th clusters) Almost 53 % of the neurons in these two clusters belong to the lateral ganglion: sensory neurons (ADF, ADL, ASE, ASG, ASH, ASI, AFD, AWA, AWB, AWC, ASJ, ASK), interneurons (AIA, AIB, AIN, AIY, AIZ, AUA, AVJ) and command interneurons (AVA, AVD, PVC). Command interneurons, which are located in the 10th cluster, by definition receive a convergence of integrative sensory inputs and output to a multifarious group of pattern-generating efferent neurons kawano2011imbalancing . This is consistent with the contact probabilities between the 10th cluster and the Worm Movements Controller. For example, there is an evidence that ablation of AVB or AVA command neurons leads to impairment of spontaneous forward or backward movements wicks1996dynamic , suggesting they are one of the most critical regulators for the directional motion. The distribution of contacts between the 10th command cluster and other clusters clearly shows its significant role in the information flow integration processes: it receives information about the outer environment from the interneurons located in the 1st, 2nd and 9th clusters (Fig. 4c) and coordinates the behavior of the worm through dense contacts with the worm movements controller. Therefore, one can propose that the 10th cluster plays the role of a ”command post” coordinating movement of a worm (clusters 5th-8th), and responsible for the implementation of the worm’s motor programs. The non-backtracking connectome clusters largely correspond to the contactome modules In two recent studies brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural a network of 10 5 membrane contacts (the contactome) from the C.elegans nerve ring was generated and analysed. The contactome data contains information about spatial neurite contacts, thus providing an important biological benchmark to compare the modules of the structural connectome. The authors in brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural have clustered the contactome using classical methods into several neuronal groups or strata that we statistically compare with the flow matrix clusters (see Fig. 6a,b). We find that all clusters of the Worm Brain compartment (1-4) have a significant intersection with four contactome stratas (Anterior, Lateral, Sublateral, Avoidance) brittin2021multi ; the p-value of the intersection is ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) . The same analysis for the second contactome dataset from moyle2021structural shows a similar result: the Worm Brain clusters intersect significantly with the first three strata. Interestingly, the Taxis strata brittin2021multi and Stratum 4 moyle2021structural have a statistically significant overlap with our 9th cluster ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) ; our 10th cluster has a statistically significant overlap with Avoidance strata brittin2021multi and Strata 4 moyle2021structural ( p ≤ 10 − 4 ) . These are the clusters comprising the Worm Information Flow Connector with vast majority of the neurons belonging to the head of the worm. Since only head neurons comprised the contactome dataset (nerve ring), the other neurons of the worm were left unassigned there. Accordingly, we see that the clusters 5-8 from the Worm Movements Controller (WMC) have significant intersections with Unclassified and Unassigned strata from the contactome datasets. All together, we conclude that the contactome modules significantly overlap with the connectome clusters of brain neurons that fall into the Worm Brain and Worm Information Flow Connector. Figure 6: P-values of the overlaps between the non-backtracking flow clusters and contactome modules: (a) Brittin et al. stratas brittin2021multi or (b) Moyle et al. stratas moyle2021structural . Next, we asked whether the same quantitative correspondence between contactome and connectome modules can be established using other clustering algorithms. For that we calculate the AMI score between the corresponding partitions, see Fig. S4 and Table S1. The maximal value of AMI score is achieved for 6 clusters, since the neurons from the other 4 clusters are missing in the contactome dataset. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, the clusters from 5 to 8 contain neurons that are left unassigned in both datasets of the contactome. Accordingly, at k = 6 the flow matrix yields connectome clusters that demonstrate the best quantitative agreement with the contactome modules among all the clustering methods (flow matrix: AMI = 0.51 for the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.47 for the Moyle et al.; IMMA algorithm: AMI = 0.4 for the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.43 for the Moyle et al.; ERMM algorithm: AMI = 0.41 for the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.36 for the Moyle et al.). Furthermore, as Fig. S4 suggests, the flow matrix clusters appear to correspond better to the contactome modules than the normalized Laplacian and modularity clusters (e.g., the FM clusters overlap by more than 20% stronger with the contactome modules than the clusters produced by the other two spectral methods). This analysis highlights that the non-backtracking algorithm yields interpretable connectome communities that strongly overlap with the contactome modules derived from the neurite spatial contacts. The obtained non-backtracking communities correspond to the neurite contacts much better than the previously reported clusters of C.elegans connectome. Conclusion In this paper we performed a detailed analysis and demonstrated applicability of the spectrum of non-backtracking random walks to the problem of the structural connectome clustering on the model example of C.elegans. This clusterization method outperforms traditional clustering methods on simulated models in the regime of low density of connections, virtually circumventing the sparsity issue and related emergence of hubs. Our analysis of the C.elegans connectome has shown that already on a relatively small network size ( N = 279 ) the communities produced by the non-backtracking method – as compared to previously reported modules in the connectome – result in a better clustering quality and biological interpretability in the terms of functions and neurite spatial contacts. We applied the non-backtracking clustering scheme for two versions of the C.elegans connectome (old Chen2006wiring and new cook2019whole ). While in both datasets k = 10 isolated eigenvalues can be seen in the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix, the detectability condition suggests that only in the new connectome all k = 10 clusters can be reliably detected (see Fig.2). Based on the complete C.elegans connectome cook2019whole , we reveal ten interpretable communities that we further classify into three distinct compartments: (i) four multifunctional head clusters full of ring neurons (’Worm Brain’); (ii) four clusters responsible for movements control in the head and tail halves of the worm (’Worm Movements Controller’); (iii) one cluster made up from the command interneurons and one cluster from the lateral ganglion consisting of sensory neurons and interneurons (’Worm Information Flow Connector’). Comparison with the recently mapped contactome modules reveals strong interpretability of the non-backtracking communities in terms of the neurite spatial contacts. We find that the ’Worm Brain’ compartment (clusters 1-4) consists of the neurons with axons that project into the anterior part of the nerve ring, while the ’Worm Information Flow Connector’ (clusters 9-10) compartment stores the amphid neurons that project axons into the posterior part of the worm head. Since the other ’Worm Movements Controller’ compartment (clusters 5-8) contains the neurons that are unclassified in the contactome, we conclude that contactome modules strongly reproduce the connectome clusters. Such a result supports Peter’s rule as a principle of synaptic specificity in the C.elegans brain. Broadly, our study highlights deep interconnections between anatomical locations (metric space embedding), mesoscopic structure (topological embedding) and biological functions of the neurons that determine behaviour of an organism. In order to derive these relationships accurately it is important to precisely resolve the topological modules in the connectome network. In the framework of the one of the simplest model organisms we demonstrate that the cluster analysis of the connectome should be performed by taking into account the intrinsic sparsity of the network, which is addressed by the non-backtracking operator informed by the corresponding detectability thresholds. Given universality of our approach, we believe it can be further extended to connectomes of more complex organisms with larger networks, where the effect of sparsity would be even more dramatic. Methods Data We have worked with old and new open-access data from the C.elegans connectome analysis project Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and Cook SJ et al. paper cook2019whole . Both datasets are updated and revised versions of the wiring data originally published in white1986structure . Neuron interactions, locations, sensory endings, and neuromuscular junctions, as well as the structure of the connectome, have been well studied and have been found to be invariant with respect to the type of animal white1986structure ; hall1991posterior , however, there is now growing concern that the C.elegans connectome is not invariant yemini2021neuropal ; brittin2021multi ; witvliet2021connectomes . Connectome 3D model used for the reconstruction of cluster elements anatomical positions was taken from the Caltech Wormbase project harris2010wormbase . The two versions of the connectome (Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and cook2019whole ) have significantly different number of edges: in the refined data of Cook SJ et al cook2019whole there is almost twice more synaptic contacts as compared to the BL Chen et al Chen2006wiring previous work ( 6334 vs 2990 ). The new hermaphrodite connectome from cook2019whole is a network with 302 vertices and 6334 edges: 1447 edges are formed by gap junctions only; 4887 contain only chemical synapses. The old hermaphrodite connectome Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural is a network with 302 vertices and 2990 edges: 796 edges are formed by gap junctions and 1962 contain only chemical synapses. The entire nervous system is broken down into two large disconnected components and two isolated neurons (CANL, CANR) and additionally the VC06 neuron is isolated in the old connectome data Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural . Twenty of the neurons in one of the components are located within the worm pharynx, which has its own separate nervous system, and the remaining 280 (or 279 for Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural ) neurons (excluding two isolated neurons) are located in various ganglia along the worm body. During the preprocessing stage, all connections in the connectome are made undirected and unweighted. Furthermore, we have divided the graph into two subgraphs according to contact types: chemical synapses or gap junctions and analyzed the connectome formed only by the synaptic contacts, because these two types of connections are fundamentally different in nature and their functions are also distinct. There is a large body of knowledge on individual neurons that produce node-wise features. In this work, we have used the classification of neurons into ten anatomically defined ganglia (posterolateral, ventral, pre-anal, lateral, dorsorectal, dorsal, retrovesicular, ventral cord, anterior and lumbar ganglia) and six functional groups (body motor neurons, head motor neurons, interneurons, sensory neurons, sex specific motor neurons, sublateral motor neurons) from altun2005handbook ; cook2019whole . As another benchmark for testing biological validity of our clusters, we have used the contactome adjacency matrices brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural , because contactome itself contains information about axon position and metric structure of the C.elegans nervous system. Contactomes have fewer number of described neurons ( 170 neurons in the brittin2021multi stratas and 181 in the moyle2021structural ), therefore we added all missing neurons to the stratas Unassigned and Unclassified correspondingly. Full contactomes descriptions could be found on Google Spreadsheet. From stochastic block model to non-backtracking random walks One of the most popular methods for community detection (in particular, of the connectome pan2010mesoscopic ) is optimization of modularity. In fact, it can be shown that the generalized modularity functional provides the entropy of a Poisson weighted stochastic block model with quenched degrees (configuration model). Such models, for example, describe the results of single-cell contact counting experiments in chromatin networks, as was shown by us recently polovnikov20 . If the degrees of all vertices d i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j are kept fixed, without additional imposed cluster structure, the expected weight of the edge under random degree-preserving randomization is simply P i \u2062 j = d i \u2062 d j ∑ i d i for i ≠ j . Assuming that the stochastic blocks are superimposed over the configuration model, each entry A i \u2062 j of the adjacency matrix of the observed network becomes a Poisson random variable with the mean P i \u2062 j \u2062 w r \u2062 t , such that the nodes i and j are assigned to the groups G r and G t , respectively. Thus, the total statistical weight of A conditioned on the cluster probability matrix W , quenched degrees d i and group labels g i can be factorized into the product of the Poisson probabilities and written down as follows 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , d i , g i ) = ∏ i < j P i \u2062 j \u2062 w g i \u2062 g j A i \u2062 j A i \u2062 j ! \u2062 exp \u2061 ( − P i \u2062 j \u2062 w g i \u2062 g j ) (8) which produces the following entropy S c \u2062 o \u2062 n \u2062 f . ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , d i , g i ) = ∑ i < j ( A i \u2062 j − γ \u2062 P i \u2062 j ) \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (9) where γ is some parameter that depends on w i \u2062 n and w o \u2062 u \u2062 t of the planted SBM (1) as follows γ = w i \u2062 n − w o \u2062 u \u2062 t log \u2061 w i \u2062 n − log \u2061 w o \u2062 u \u2062 t (10) Clearly, the entropic functional (9) up to the parameter γ is nothing but the modularity functional, which is widely used in clustering tasks, for connectome clustering as well pan2010mesoscopic . It is important to note that generally the parameter γ have to be chosen self-consistently with the cluster parameters of the partition (10), for which the iterative procedure has been recently proposed polovnikov20 . Modularity optimization has been originally proposed and proved to be useful for clusterization of scale-free networks, since, as we have shown above, it explicitly conserves the scale-free property of the degree distribution under stochastic randomization. Although most of the real-world networks are scale-free, modularity is one of the most popular approaches in spectral clustering. However, if one relaxes the degrees preservation assumption, the background probability becomes uniform P i \u2062 j = p and the underlying graph is assumed to be simply a G \u2062 ( N , p ) Erdos-Renyi graph. Then the second term in (9) does not depend on cluster labels of the nodes, and maximization of the entropy for a given amount of clusters corresponds to maximization of the adjacency functional S E \u2062 R ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , g i ) = ∑ i < j A i \u2062 j \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (11) which is trying to maximize the internal weight of the clusters. In a more general problem setting of a manifold learning, one is looking for the optimal representation (embedding) of N vertices in a low-dimensional space described by a set of coordinates g i , i = 1 , 2 , … , N (suppose, the latent space is one-dimensional for simplicity). As long as close points in the original high-dimensional space should be eventually put close in the latent space, the natural functional to be minimized is S M \u2062 L ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , g i ) = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i ≠ j A i \u2062 j \u2062 ( g i − g j ) 2 (12) which can be written as a quadratic form of the graph Laplacian, L = D − A S M \u2062 L ∝ ∑ i , j L i \u2062 j \u2062 g i \u2062 g j (13) Of course, a similar functional over latent coordinates can be written for the modularity functional (9) as well. Thus, we see that statistical inference of the optimal cluster structure is associated with optimization of a certain functional over partition of graph nodes. However, finding the global maximum of (9),(11),(13) is a very difficult computational task. To overcome this difficulty, spectral methods are used, which rely on the fact that the most essential information about the optimal partition is encoded in the first non-trivial eigenvectors of the corresponding operator. Indeed, the quadratic form associated with the manifold learning problem can be approximated by projecting the coordinates to the leading eigenvectors of the operator. Modularity matrix In newman2004finding the modularity matrix of a graph was defined as M := A − d \u2062 d T 2 \u2062 C , (14) where A is the adjacency matrix, d = ( d 1 , … , d n ) T is the degree-vector comprised of the vertices degrees and C = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i = 1 n d i is the total number of edges in the network. We computed a quantitative measure of modularity for each partition of graphs into several communities, using the standard Newman’s modularity (Q value): Q := 1 2 \u2062 C \u2062 ∑ i , j ( A i , j − d i \u2062 d j ∑ i d i ) \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (15) By notation, A is the adjacency matrix of connectome ( A i \u2062 j = 1 , if neurons i , j are connected, and 0 , otherwise). The degree of each vertex i is given by d i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j . C is the total number of edges on the connectome graph, equal to C = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i d i and δ is the Kronecker delta and g i is the label of the community to which vertex i is assigned. As we see, (15) is different from the entropic functional (9) by a particular normalization coefficient used. Laplacian and normalized Laplacian Laplacian is widely used in spectral manifold learning methods, a framework known as Laplacian Eigenmaps. The graph Laplacian matrix is defined as L := D − A , (16) where A is the adjacency and D is the diagonal matrix of degrees. Though Laplacian is related to many physical phenomena, such as heat propagation, a more direct connection with random walks is provided by the Normalized Laplacian (or Random Walks Laplacian), L R \u2062 W = D − 1 \u2062 L , which is also frequently used for clustering. Note that L R \u2062 W is non-symmetric, however, its spectrum is real. Obviously, L R \u2062 W has the same set of eigenvalues as the symmetric normalized Laplacian L n \u2062 o \u2062 r \u2062 m := D 1 / 2 \u2062 L R \u2062 W \u2062 D − 1 / 2 = D − 1 / 2 \u2062 L \u2062 D − 1 / 2 = I − D − 1 / 2 \u2062 A \u2062 D − 1 / 2 . (17) Similarity measures In order to assess the similarity between different partitions and biological benchmarks we use the adjusted mutual information score (AMI), defined as follows. Suppose that we have a set S and two partitions of S : U and V , the elements of the partitions are called clusters. Let us denote the probability that some random object falls into a cluster U i of U as P U \u2062 ( i ) which is equal to  U i   S  . The entropy calculated for the partition U is equal to H \u2062 ( U ) = − ∑ i = 1 R P U \u2062 ( i ) \u2062 log \u2061 P U \u2062 ( i ) . Using the introduced notation, we can express the mutual information for U and V as M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) := ∑ i = 1 R ∑ j = 1 C P U \u2062 V \u2062 ( i , j ) \u2062 log \u2061 P U \u2062 V \u2062 ( i , j ) P U \u2062 ( i ) \u2062 P V \u2062 ( j ) . (18) Importantly, this measure of similarity tends to be larger when the two partitions have a larger number of clusters even when we use the same number of elements for clustering. To avoid such biases one can use the adjusted mutual information which is defined as A \u2062 M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) := M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) − E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } max \u2061 { H \u2062 ( U ) , H \u2062 ( V ) } − E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } , (19) where E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } is the expected value of the mutual information of V and U . Therefore, AMI is 0 when the similarity is equal to its expected value under random permutation of the vertices between the groups and 1 for identical partitions.

The AMI score is averaged over 200 realizations of random SBM graphs with fixed parameters (the error bars reflect the corresponding statistical error). For each realization of a random graph AMI score is computed between the underlying SBM partition (the ground truth) and clusters inferred in that graph by four different operators: Laplacian, normalized Laplacian, modularity operator and flow matrix.

          "Abstract The fundamental relationship between the mesoscopic structure of neuronal circuits and organismic functions they subserve is one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Formation of structurally connected modules of neurons enacts the conversion from single-cell firing to large-scale behaviour of an organism, highlighting the importance of their accurate profiling in the data. While connectomes are typically characterized by significant sparsity of neuronal connections, recent advances in network theory and machine learning have revealed fundamental limitations of traditionally used community detection approaches in cases where the network is sparse. Here we studied the optimal community structure in the structural connectome of C.elegans, for which we exploited a non-conventional approach that is based on non-backtracking random walks, virtually eliminating the sparsity issue. In full agreement with the previous asymptotic results, we demonstrated that non-backtracking walks resolve the ground truth annotation into clusters on stochastic block models (SBM) with the size and density of the connectome better than the spectral methods related to simple random walks. Based on the cluster detectability threshold, we determined that the optimal number of modules in a recently mapped connectome of C.elegans is 10, which precisely corresponds to the number of isolated eigenvalues in the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. The discovered communities have a clear interpretation in terms of their functional role, which allows one to discern three structural compartments in the worm: the Worm Brain (WB), the Worm Movement Controller (WMC), and the Worm Information Flow Connector (WIFC). Broadly, our work provides a robust network-based framework to reveal mesoscopic structures in sparse connectomic datasets, paving way to further investigation of connectome mechanisms for different functions. Introduction Complexity of biological and social systems driven by collective behaviour of their agents is commonly studied using network (or graph) representation, where nodes represent agents and edges correspond to pairwise coupling between them. The resulting dimensionality reduction frequently allows to extract the most valuable information about hidden relationships governing static and dynamic properties of a system. One of the most striking and practically important examples of such information is the mesoscopic organization of the network in modules or communities. The nervous system is no exception in this regard as it can be represented as a structural connectome, that is, a graph, where vertices are nerve cells and edges reflect direct structural connections (wiring) between them. Similarly to most of real-world networks, the connectome is extremely sparse, that is, its number of theoretically possible connections between neurons greatly exceeds the factual amount of connections karrer2014percolation . Such a reduction of excessive edges is a consequence of network modularity, a tendency to form assortative communities (modules) with relatively loose inter-connections. Like an effective team work of people where complex problem requires distribution of tasks among specialized groups of participants, mesoscopic organization of neurons in a connectome serves to facilitate certain functions of the nervous system, such as ”fire together wire together” principle, hebb1949first . Thus, accurate detecting of modules (communities) in the connectome data can help to establish a conversion between micro-level single neuron interactions and macro-level organism behaviour. Community detection is an extremely hot topic in various fields such as technological albert99 ; broder00 , biological dekker13 ; ravasz02 , social redner98 ; chen09 and economical piccardi10 ; polovnikov_jphysa20 ; polovnikov_ijcai22 fields. A widely used approach in community detection is a spectral decomposition of a linear operator defined on a network: information about communities is then encoded in several leading eigenvectors Von2007tutorial ; krivelevich03 . It was shown that all commonly used matrices (adjacency, Laplacian, modularity, non-backtracking, see Methods) readily classify nodes as long as the network density is sufficient nadakuditi12 ; decelle11 . In particular, the modularity", 
          "operator is one of the most efficient instruments that successfully detects communities in stochastic networks of various nature newman06 ; chen09 ; norton18 ; salespardo07 . The modularity operator can be used to extract mesoscopic organization in C.elegans pan10 . Sparse graphs are a special case where most of the traditional community detection methods suffer from fundamental limitations. Namely, at a given cluster strength there is a critical network density below which community detection becomes a very difficult problem Krzakala2013spectral . Furthermore, traditionally used operators (adjacency, Laplacian, modularity) turn out to fail above this threshold, since their leading eigenvectors rapidly become uncorrelated with the intrinsic community structure upon decrease of network density. This behaviour is explained as the emergence of vertices with anomalously high degree (hubs), which eventually perturbs the spectral edge of these operators because of the “Lifshitz tails” in the spectral density of sparse graphs (Reichardt06 ; Arenas08 ; nechaev18 ). Localization on hubs, and not on the communities, is thus a major drawback for all conventional spectral methods in the sparse regime. To address this issue, Krzakala et al. proposed Krzakala2013spectral to make use of the non-backtracking (Hashimoto) random walks on the associated directed graph. By construction, such walks cannot revisit the same node immediately at the following step and, as a result, they do not localize on hubs. The leading eigenvectors of the non-backtracking operator (the transfer matrix of non-backtracking walks) encode for the community structure of the graph up to the theoretical resolution limit Krzakala2013spectral . Due to their intrinsic ability to deal with sparse graphs, the non-backtracking walks have received increasing attention in the analysis of biological datasets. Recently we have shown that this approach allows to annotate compartments in the three-dimensional chromatin organization at the single-cell level polovnikov20 . Figure 1: Clusterization of C.elegans connectome by means of the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix: 0. A simplified scheme of the C.elegans nervous system; 1. Representation of the connectome as the adjacency matrix; 2. Construction of non-backtracking walks on the connectome network; 3.

In this work, we examine neuronal connectivity in Caenorhabditis elegans — one of the simplest organisms with a structural connectome first mapped by White et al. in 1986 white1986structure , which has been completely described by now cook2019whole . The nervous system is a prominent part of C.elegans with almost one third of all cells in its body being neurons. Importantly, the morphology, location and connectivity of each neuron are remarkably invariant between individuals hall1991posterior (it is worth noting that there is now a growing concern on to what extent this is actually true yemini2021neuropal ; brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural ; witvliet2021connectomes ), which arguably makes this",
      "organism a convenient model for studying neuronal connectivity and related functions. Curiously, due to the elongated shape of the nervous system of the worm, the adjacency matrix of the C.elegans connectome is similar to a single-cell chromosome contact map, which describes the spatial proximity of loci in individual conformations of chromosomes nagano13 ; polovnikov20 . The so-called scaling in both types of matrices, being a generic polymer (or worm-like chain) feature, is a major source of sparsity in the data. This prompts one to apply to the C.elegans connectome the clustering procedures that has been specifically designed for reliable detection of communities in sparse networks. Here we study the mesoscopic organization of C.elegans connectome by means of the non-backtracking walks. Namely, we construct the Newman’s non-backtracking flow operator, which describes the transfer probability of a random walk on the associated directed connectome with prohibited immediate revisiting. The isolated part of the flow matrix spectrum is known to encode for communities and can be used by the clustering algorithm. We ran simulations of community detection on stochastic block models (SBMs) of the corresponding size and density as the connectome and demonstrated that the non-backtracking flow matrix outperformed all traditional operators, in the full agreement with asymptotic results of Krzakala2013spectral . In particular, we show better performance of non-backtracking walks over the modularity operator and other approaches, which were previously used for spectral clustering of the C.elegance connectome pan10 ; pavlovic2014stochastic . We consider two C.elegans connectome datasets: ”old” (Chen et al, 2006) Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and ”new” (Cook et al, 2019) cook2019whole . The difference in data completeness between these datasets is quite significant: the number of the edges has approximately doubled in the new connectome (for more details see Methods). We reveal that despite the evident difference in the network density, the modular organization of the two connectomes is rather similar, as reflected by the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. To establish the detectable amount of communities for each connectome data we propose an algorithm based on the theoretical detectability threshold for SBM-like graphs. In the new data cook2019whole our approach reveals 10 detectable communities in the C.elegans connectome, matching the number of isolated eigenvalues in the flow matrix spectrum. The biological interpretation of the communities in the complete connectome suggests that the found clusters highly correlate with the co-localization of neurites (so-called, contactome) in the nervous system of the worm, can be further associated with specific neuronal functions and also overlap with the anatomically defined ganglia. Importantly, we demonstrate that the non-backtracking clusters are much better interpretable than partitions by other spectral algorithms, as well as the modules reported previously pavlovic2014stochastic ; pan2010mesoscopic . Ultimately our integrative analysis of the mesoscopic structure of the structural connectome and related functions has revealed three neuronal compartments in the C.elegans: A. Worm Brain, B. Worm Movements Controller, C. Worm Information Flow Connector. Stochastic block model and non-backtracking random walks Here we provide a network theory background underlying clustering methods, which is instructive for the definition of the model. The particular connection with several widely used spectral clustering approaches is described in the Methods section. Stochastic block model (SBM) is a commonly used benchmark for community detection in real-world networks, with several important results obtained for asymptotically large networks decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 ; newman06 ; newman_sparse ; newman2006modularity ; Krzakala2013spectral . By definition, a SBM is a generalization of an Erdös-Renyi random graph on N nodes, where all edges are generated independently with the probability p that depends on the type of the nodes that it connects. The nodes in a graph belong to k different types (clusters), G i , i = 1 , 2 , … , k . Thus, each pair of nodes ( i , j ) : i ∈ G r , j ∈ G t gets independently connected by an edge with some probability w r \u2062 t , which can be written as a matrix of pairwise cluster probabilities W = { w r \u2062 t } with ( r , t ) = 1 , 2 , … , k . The corresponding entry in the adjacency matrix A i \u2062 j is 1 with probability w r \u2062 t and 0 otherwise. In the simplest version of the model (the planted SBM), all off-diagonal elements of the matrix W are the same and equal to w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , while all diagonal elements of W are equal to w i \u2062 n : W r \u2062 t = { w i \u2062 n , r = t w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , r ≠ t . (1) The assortative community structure corresponds to w i \u2062 n > w o \u2062 u \u2062 t . In the connectome context, the neurons belonging to the same cluster have a preferentially higher probability to be connected with a link than the neurons from different clusters. Still, some of the neurons within the same cluster in the structural connectome are not connected (clusters are not always cliques), allowing one to make use of stochastic models. Importantly, for SBMs there is a certain threshold on the minimally allowed difference Δ \u2062 w = w i \u2062 n − w o \u2062 u \u2062 t between the probabilities in order for the cluster structure to be resolved decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 . Following conventional notation, let us introduce the rescaled cluster affinities, c i \u2062 n = N \u2062 w i \u2062 n and c o \u2062 u \u2062 t = N \u2062 w o \u2062 u \u2062 t , which scale linearly with the number of the inner and outer edges of a typical community. The detectability rule suggests that the SBM clusters are asymptotically resolved",
      "( N ≫ 1 ) as long as c i \u2062 n − c o \u2062 u \u2062 t > k \u2062 c , (2) where c = ( c i \u2062 n + c o \u2062 u \u2062 t ) / 2 is the average of c i \u2062 n , c o \u2062 u \u2062 t . For dense networks c i \u2062 n , c o \u2062 u \u2062 t , c ∼ O \u2062 ( N ) and, thus, condition (2) is satisfied at any small Δ \u2062 w > 0 . In the sparse case, c ∼ O \u2062 ( 1 ) , the threshold (2) provides a practically important condition on the parameters Δ \u2062 w and k for the cluster structure to be resolved. Spectral methods, such as Laplacian, adjacency or modularity, have been widely used to uncover the community structure in relatively dense stochastic block model networks newman_sparse ; newman2006modularity ; newman06 ; nadakuditi12 ; reluct ; Von2007tutorial . The leading non-trivial eigenvectors of the corresponding operators provide dimensionality reduction of the system and these latent coordinates are then used by some conventional clustering algorithm (such as k-means) to perform partitioning into specified number of clusters Von2007tutorial . However, as it was noted in Krzakala2013spectral , for sparse networks the leading eigenvectors become uncorrelated with true community structure above the theoretical threshold (2). This is because of the abundance of star-like sub-graphs (hubs) in a sparse network, which are identified by these operators instead of cyclic subgraphs associated with the internal structure of communities. Indeed, as these operators are related to random walks on a graph, true clusters interfere with hubs in their spectrum. As a result, it turns out that the spectral methods that exploit random-walk-related operators (such as modularity, adjacency or Laplacian) fail to find communities in rather sparse networks, despite of the network parameters satisfying the detectability condition (2). To overcome this difficulty, the spectrum of the Hashimoto matrix B can be utilized, which is a transfer matrix of non-backtracking walks on a graph. It is defined on the edges of the directed graph, i → j , k → l , as follows B i → j , k → l = { A i \u2062 j \u2062 A k \u2062 l \u2062 if \u2062 j = k \u2062 and \u2062 l ≠ i 0 \u2062 otherwise , (3) It is seen from (3) that the non-backtracking operator prohibits returns to the point which a walker visited at the previous step, thus effectively circumventing localization on the hubs. Notably, matrix B is non-symmetric and has a complex spectrum. For Poissonian graphs, the spectrum of B is constrained within a circle in the complex plane, whereas real eigenvalues of B lying out of the circle are relevant to the community structure even in sparse networks. Associating the corresponding eigenvectors with the network partitioning allows detecting communities all the way down to the theoretical limit (2). Interestingly, a ”reluctant” version of the non-backtracking operator allows exploring the hanging trees of the network reluct , which the original operator B ignores by construction. In newman_sparse the corresponding flow operator was proposed, which conserves the probability flow at each step of the non-backtracking walker (see Fig. 1): F i → j , k → l = δ j \u2062 k \u2062 ( 1 − δ l \u2062 i ) d j − 1 , (4) where d j is the degree of the vertex j . While the powers of non-backtracking matrix B count the non-backtracking walks of particular length on a graph, the flow matrix F is the transfer matrix of the non-backtracking probability. Similarly to the non-backtracking matrix, the bulk of the spectrum of F lies in the complex plane within a circle of the radius r = ⟨ d \u2062 ( d − 1 ) − 1 ⟩ ⟨ d ⟩ , (5) but, as shown in newman_sparse , has a more clear edge of the spectral band. Importantly, the amount of isolated eigenvalues in the spectrum of the flow matrix corresponds to the number of clusters in SBM network newman_sparse . In what follows, we will use the flow matrix (4) for the purpose of the connectome clustering. The flow matrix F defines the non-backtracking probability flow along the edges. While one is interested in the classification of the nodes, the eigenvectors of F have to be carefully translated from the space of edges to the space of nodes. This is conventionally performed using the relation between the quadratic forms of modularity and flow operators newman_sparse ; polovnikov20 . From this correspondence one can see that contribution u i to the i -th node of the graph comes from the in-flow along all the directed edges adjacent to i . This procedure can be formally written as follows u i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j \u2062 v j → i F (6) where v j → i F is the component of the eigenvector of the flow matrix, corresponding to the directed edge j → i . The element of the adjacency matrix A i \u2062 j is non-zero as long as there is an edge between i to j . Using (6) one can switch from edges to nodes representation of the non-backtracking flow and perform clustering of the nodes, e.g. using k-means on leading vectors u i . Trivially, isolated vertices in a graph have undefined values of the flow, and they are not involved in graph clustering.",
      "Clustering the connectome of a worm: how many clusters are detectable? The nervous system is one of the most complex parts of the nematode C.elegans as the neurons constitute one third of all cells in this organism. The graph of the hermaphrodite connectome consists of N = 302 vertices representing neurons and C = 4887 edges (chemical synapses, see Methods) between them representing structural connections, as recorded in the new dataset cook2019whole . Since only 11 % of the theoretically possible number of edges are present in the network, one may conclude that we deal with a rather sparse network. In the old dataset, in contrast, the network density is less than 5 % , thus increasing the role of sparsity, as we will see below. In order to obtain communities in C.elegans connectome we implemented the spectral clustering approach, based on the leading non-trivial eigenvectors of the non-backtracking flow matrix (4). The spectrum of the actual network corresponding to the new data is shown in the Fig. 1. Its isolated part, which is essential for the spectral clustering, consists of the maximal (trivial) eigenvalue and 9 smaller eigenvalues that lie on the real line outside the bulk, constrained by a circle of the radius (5). This picture suggests that there are 10 communities in the network, encoded in the corresponding eigenvectors newman_sparse . As we further found, the amount of isolated eigenvalues is invariant in both datasets analysed (see Fig. S2), despite the two-fold difference in the network density. This implies the existence of a stable mesoscopic structure, as revealed by the non-backtracking spectrum. Then we asked – and this is not trivial – how many clusters out of 10 can be reliably resolved in the given data. To this end, we suggest an approach based on the detectability threshold (2). Namely, we note that for a given mean cluster strength Δ \u2062 w the condition (2) establishes the maximum number of clusters that can be resolved in the sparse network of a given size N and the average link probability w = c / N . Therefore, the critical number of clusters is related to the network parameters as follows k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = Δ \u2062 w w \u2062 N . (7) To find k m \u2062 a \u2062 x in the C.elegans connectome we cluster the network into consecutive number of clusters k = 2 , 3 , 4 , … , 10 using the eigenvectors of the non-backtracking flow matrix and determine c i \u2062 n and c o \u2062 u \u2062 t as the average amount of intra- and inter- links in the detected clusters. For each dataset we can determine the maximal amount of clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x , such that c i \u2062 n − c o \u2062 u \u2062 t is still greater than k \u2062 c (see the sketch in Fig. 2, explaining the procedure). Thus, the resulting value of k m \u2062 a \u2062 x provides the number of detectable communities, according to the detectability condition (2). An hierarchy of resulting community structures for different k is shown in Fig. 1. While the total number of isolated eigenvalues is invariant in both datasets, the detectability condition clearly suggests a strong sensitivity of the amount of resolvable clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x to the network density of the sparse experimental data (see Fig. 2). In the old and incomplete connectome data Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural only k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = 7 clusters can be resolved, thus, the remaining 3 modules cannot be established due to strong sparsity of the data. At the same time, based on the same detectability condition applied to the new connectome data cook2019whole with doubled density of synaptic connections, we conclude that all k m \u2062 a \u2062 x = 10 communities can be reliably recovered using the information from the flow matrix eigenvectors. Figure 2: Graphical representation of the condition (2) as a criterion for the optimal number of clusters that can be detected (a) in the old Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and (b) new cook2019whole connectome data. The intersection point of blue and orange curves provides the maximal amount of clusters k m \u2062 a \u2062 x at which the detectability condition (2) is satisfied. Non-backtracking flow outperforms other spectral methods in clustering of connectomes Having found the detectable number of modules, we next compared the performance of the non-backtracking flow matrix with traditional clustering operators, such as the normalized Laplacian and modularity matrix, on artificial networks with statistical properties similar to the experimental dataset cook2019whole . To this end, we generated a family of stochastic block models with blocks similar to the ones we have obtained in the C.elegans connectome. Namely, we fixed the network size, N = 279 , the outer-cluster probability, w o \u2062 u \u2062 t = 0.05 , and the total number of clusters, k = 7 . Furthermore, the sizes of the simulated blocks were chosen to match the sizes of the clusters in the original data. The only parameter subject to variation was the inner-cluster probability, w i \u2062 n = { 0.05 , … , 0.22 , … , 0.6 } . For each value of w i \u2062 n we generated 200 random SBMs. We ran the spectral clustering on k = 7 leading eigenvectors of four operators: non-backtracking flow, normalized Laplacian, Laplacian and modularity. The partitions predicted by the four operators were then assessed using the AMI scores, see Fig. S1. The results demonstrate distinctively better performance of the non-backtracking flow and normalized Laplacian over the modularity and Laplacian in prediction of the ground truth cluster structure of the simulated SBMs. The flow operator slightly outperformed the normalized Laplacian, especially in the region of intermediate relative cluster strengths, w i \u2062 n / w o \u2062 u \u2062 t ≈ 4 − 5 , which correspond to the empirical value. Such a moderate difference in prediction scores between the two operators is the result of a small network size N . As it was previously shown, in the limit of large (asymptotic) networks the non-backtracking operator outperforms the normalized Laplacian as well Krzakala2013spectral . Notably, the empirical value w i \u2062 n / w o \u2062 u \u2062 t ≈ 4.4 , labeled by red dots on the AMI curves, is close to the detectability limit, as in this critical",
      "region AMI abruptly decays to zero (see Fig. S1). For large N ≫ 1 there is an associated phase transition decelle2011asymptotic ; decelle11 thus highlighting criticality of the worm connectome. Figure 3: Quality comparison of different spectral approaches on the new connectome data cook2019whole . (a) Q-values (15) of partitions into k clusters by various operators. (b) Partitions of the C.elegans connectome into k = 10 clusters obtained by different spectral methods. Each of the ten clusters inferred by the flow operator is annotated with a unique color according to its compartmental affiliation. (c) AMI score between ganglia and structural partitions for different number of clusters k . Next we turned to performance analysis of different clustering algorithms on the experimental network. We compute the Q-scores for each of the annotations into clusters, which is equal to the modularity score of the partition and is defined on the basis of the Newman-Girvan modularity operator (see Methods). Using this metric we reveal a better quality of non-backtracking flow clusters for various values of the total number of clusters k (see Fig. 3a). As one can infer from Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, for all k , except for k = 8 , the estimated quality of clustering by the flow operator outperforms other spectral approaches. In particular, the leading eigenvectors of the modularity matrix provide much poorer annotation into clusters, despite the quality metric being based on the modularity. This result is due to the sparsity issue discussed above; the leading spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix much better approximates the optimum of modularity function of a sparse graph than the leading spectrum of the modularity matrix itself. At the same time, we see that the normalized Laplacian produces annotations with similar, but steadily lower quality compared to the non-backtracking flow operator, in accord with the analysis of the SBM networks above (Fig. S1). Additionally, we have clustered the connectome using Infomap algorithm rosvall2009map . Interestingly, the Infomap suggests that the optimal number of clusters equals to k = 3 and provides a similar value of the modularity as obtained by the leading eigenvectors of the flow matrix ( Q ≈ 0.38 ), see Fig. 3(a). However, it fails to find all the clusters that evidently exist in the network (Fig. 2). To complement our analysis of Q-scores and better understand the (dis-)similarity of predictions by the flow matrix and other operators we further compute the pairwise relative overlaps between the clusters for the particular value of k = 10 (see Fig. S3). With the overlap threshold in 80 % we find that 5 out of 10 modularity clusters poorly correspond to the flow matrix clusters, which translates into approximately 10 % difference in the Q-scores (Fig. 3a). In the full agreement with the analysis above, only 3 clusters of normalized Laplacian overlap with the flow matrix clusters by less than 80 % . Importantly, the smallest 10th cluster of the flow operator (consisting of as few as 7 neurons) is not resolved by normalized Laplacian. It is not fully resolved by modularity operator neither: despite an apparently high overlap with a modularity cluster (consisting of 4 neurons), the modularity fails to capture the other 3 neurons of the 10th flow matrix cluster. Indeed, tiny clusters in sparse networks present a particular challenge for traditional algorithms. Additionally, we compare the structural clusters with ganglia. While ganglia represent the groups defined purely by anatomy and cannot be used as the ground truth for the structural partitions, they provide an important biological benchmark to estimate the technical noise produced by different clustering algorithms. We find that for sufficiently large number of clusters k > 4 , the AMI score for the non-backtracking flow takes the highest value compared to all", 
      "other algorithms, Fig. 3c. It is also worth noting that enrichment of the edges in the new dataset cook2019whole has significantly increased the mutual information between the structural modules and the ganglia (Table S1). Still, similarity between the cluster groups obtained from old and new data is rather strong, see Fig. 4a. Furthermore, as Fig. 4b suggests, all flow matrix clusters in the new data have a statistically significant overlap with at least one ganglia ( p ≤ 10 − 3 ). As another biological benchmark, we consider partitioning of the C.elegans nervous system into six groups corresponding to different neuronal functions: motor neurons (head, body, sublateral, sex specific), sensory neurons, interneurons (see Google Spreadsheet and Fig. 4c). Noticeably, three functional types (BM, HM and SM) are located within a particular group of clusters ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ), as derived by the flow matrix; body motor neurons belong to 5th-8th clusters, head motor neurons mostly locate in the 4th cluster, sublateral motor neurons locate in the 2nd cluster. The group of interneurons belongs to the 1st and the 10th cluster (at p ≈ 10 − 3 ) and sensory neurons are spread between the 3rd, 4th and 9th clusters. Put together, the statistical analysis of clusters obtained on real and simulated connectomes suggests that the non-backtracking flow operator outperforms conventional clustering approaches on networks of size and composition similar to the C.elegans connectome. Comparison with previously reported connectome modules It is instructive to compare the results of the our algorithm (flow matrix) with other partitions reported in the literature. Here we analyse the results obtained by different approaches on the old dataset Chen2006wiring , since to the best of our knowledge there have been no attempts to cluster the new connectome data in the literature. Two open-source alternative annotations are considered, which were obtained by two different algorithms: iterative modularity maximization (IMMA) pan2010mesoscopic and Erdos-Renyi mixture model (ERMM) pavlovic2014stochastic . The IMMA approach is based on maximization of the modularity score ( k = 6 modules were found for the weighted connectome); the ERMM is a non-deterministic algorithm that fits an arbitrary, not planted, SBM network to the real connectome data ( k = 9 modules were found). First we compute the Q-scores of the clusters as obtained by the algorithms and compare to the quality of clusters produced by the flow matrix. We find that the flow matrix clusters produce a significantly higher quality of partition with the modularity value of 0.32 , which is to be compared with 0.27 and 0.19 for ERMM and IMMA clusters, respectively. Next, we compute the mutual information between partitions predicted by various methods and biological benchmarks. As Table S1 demonstrates, the IMMA algorithm yields worse agreement with the ganglia (AMI = 0.31 ) as compared to the flow matrix clusters (AMI = 0.34 ). At the same time, the ERMM approach has the same AMI score with ganglia",
          "Figure 4: (a) Cosine similarity measure between WB, WMC and WIFC compartments for the old Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and new connectome data cook2019whole . (b) P-value of overlaps between the FM clusters and ganglia. (c) P-value of overlaps between the FM clusters and functional groups (BM – body motor neurons, HM – head motor neurons, I – interneurons, S – sensory neurons, SSM – sex specific motor neurons, SM – sublateral motor neurons). (AMI = 0.34 ) and the mutual information between the ERMM and flow matrix clusters is sufficiently high (AMI = 0.45 ). Also both the flow matrix and ERMM algorithm grouped command interneurons from the lateral ganglion together ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) . Besides that, motor neurons were united into structural clusters by all three methods, see Fig. S5. All three methods successfully split parts of sensory neurons and interneurons, but only flow matrix was able to isolate the polymodal neurons ( p ≤ 10 − 4 ) . Overall, we conclude that the previous partitions of C.elegans connectome, based on the old dataset Chen2006wiring , display lower quality of clustering (Q-values) and worse biological interpretability than can be achieved using the leading part of the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix. Cross-talk between the clusters is determined by neuronal programs On the basis of the complementary nature of detected communities (functional roles and anatomical locations), we reveal the following neuronal compartments. This classification is supported by similar neuronal functions and/or 3D coordinates in the worm body: the Worm Brain (1st-4th); the Worm Movement Controller (5th-8th); the Worm Information Flow Connector (9th and 10th). It should be noted that the neurons listed below are the names of the neuron sets, for example, VA contains twelve individual neurons VA1-VA12 or ADA contains ADAL and ADAR. For detailed description of cluster elements see Fig. 5.• Worm Brain (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th clusters) Similarly to the multifunctional organization of the brain of more complex organisms, we found that neurons in these four clusters had a common anatomical position and were involved in complex multimodal processes white1986structure . Based on the corresponding 3D model (see Fig 5), one can note that the 3rd and 4th clusters are closer to the nose of the worm and the 1st and 2nd clusters are located behind them. This anatomical similarity between the clusters is consistent with their close functions. Accordingly, all polymodal neurons of the head part of the worm (IL1, IL1D, IL1V, OLQD, OLQV, RIM, ASH) and sensory neurons of the anterior ganglion (IL2D, IL2, IL2V, OLL) are located in the 3rd cluster. Wherein bilaterally symmetric neurons split between these two clusters, thus 27 out of 28 neurons of the 3rd cluster are right neurons (R), while 21 out of 29 neurons of the 4th cluster are left ones (L) (see Google Spreadsheet). The majority of interneurons (ADA, RIA, RIB, RIF, RIG, RIH, RIR, RIS, RIV, URB, URX, SAAD, SAAV, AVK, SDQ, SIAD, SIAV, SIBD, SIBV) belong to the 1st and 2nd clusters. Such a ”layered” organization is consistent with intuition about how the signals received by the worm’s nervous system should be processed. • Worm Movements Controller (5th, 6th, 7th and 8th clusters) These four clusters contain the ventral cord neural group, which is split between them according to the anatomical positions of the neurons. Namely, neurons in the head half fall into the 5th and 6th clusters, while neurons in the tail body half fall into the 7th and 8th clusters (Fig. 5).", 
          "Figure 5: Three-dimensional visualization of the detected clusters in the connectome. On the basis of the complementary analysis of functional roles and anatomical locations, we identify three compartments: WB, WMC, WIFC. Original 3 D coordinates were taken from the Caltech Wormbase project harris2010wormbase.",
      "Together, almost 83 % of neurons in these four clusters belong to the ventral cord (AS, DA, DB, DD, VA, VB, VC, VD, AVE), which motoneurons are located along the entire body of the worm and split exactly into two groups in accordance with which half of the body of the worm these neurons belong to: 5th and 6th clusters correspond to the head part and 7th and 8th clusters are responsible for the tail movements (bright and dark green colors Fig. 5). The remaining 17 % are represented by neurons of the tail ganglia: pre-anal ganglion, and dorsorectal ganglion (PV, LUA, PWV, PDA, PDB, DVA, DVB, DBC) and belong to the 8th cluster, which is responsible for the tail part of the ventral cord (Fig. 4b). Excitatory motor neurons in the ventral cord function as motor rhythm generators and underlie body undulation during reversal and forward movements wen2018caenorhabditis . That is why we refer this pair as a worm movements controller. The connection probabilities between these four clusters are reasonably low ( ≈ 5 % in average), which is tenable if we interpret them as disjoint parts of the movement control system, and the dense connections between motor neurons from opposite parts of the worm body are not functionally significant. • Worm Information Flow Connector (9th and 10th clusters) Almost 53 % of the neurons in these two clusters belong to the lateral ganglion: sensory neurons (ADF, ADL, ASE, ASG, ASH, ASI, AFD, AWA, AWB, AWC, ASJ, ASK), interneurons (AIA, AIB, AIN, AIY, AIZ, AUA, AVJ) and command interneurons (AVA, AVD, PVC). Command interneurons, which are located in the 10th cluster, by definition receive a convergence of integrative sensory inputs and output to a multifarious group of pattern-generating efferent neurons kawano2011imbalancing . This is consistent with the contact probabilities between the 10th cluster and the Worm Movements Controller. For example, there is an evidence that ablation of AVB or AVA command neurons leads to impairment of spontaneous forward or backward movements wicks1996dynamic , suggesting they are one of the most critical regulators for the directional motion. The distribution of contacts between the 10th command cluster and other clusters clearly shows its significant role in the information flow integration processes: it receives information about the outer environment from the interneurons located in the 1st, 2nd and 9th clusters (Fig. 4c) and coordinates the behavior of the worm through dense contacts with the worm movements controller. Therefore, one can propose that the 10th cluster plays the role of a ”command post” coordinating movement of a worm (clusters 5th-8th), and responsible for the implementation of the worm’s motor programs. The non-backtracking connectome clusters largely correspond to the contactome modules In two recent studies brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural a network of 10 5 membrane contacts (the contactome) from the C.elegans nerve ring was generated and analysed. The contactome data contains information about spatial neurite contacts, thus providing an important biological benchmark to compare the modules of the structural connectome. The authors in brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural have clustered the contactome using classical methods into several neuronal groups or strata that we statistically compare with the flow matrix clusters (see Fig. 6a,b). We find that all clusters of the Worm Brain compartment (1-4) have a significant intersection with four contactome stratas (Anterior, Lateral, Sublateral, Avoidance) brittin2021multi ; the p-value of the intersection is ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) . The same analysis for the second contactome dataset from moyle2021structural shows a similar result: the Worm Brain clusters intersect significantly with the first three strata. Interestingly, the Taxis strata brittin2021multi and Stratum 4 moyle2021structural have a statistically significant overlap with our 9th cluster ( p ≤ 10 − 5 ) ; our 10th cluster has a statistically significant overlap with Avoidance strata brittin2021multi and Strata 4 moyle2021structural ( p ≤ 10 − 4 ) . These are the clusters comprising the Worm Information Flow Connector with vast majority of the neurons belonging to the head of the worm. Since only head neurons comprised the contactome dataset (nerve ring), the other neurons of the worm were left unassigned there. Accordingly, we see that the clusters 5-8 from the Worm Movements Controller (WMC) have significant intersections with Unclassified and Unassigned strata from the contactome datasets. All together, we conclude that the contactome modules significantly overlap with the connectome clusters of brain neurons that fall into the Worm Brain and Worm Information Flow Connector. Next, we asked whether the same quantitative correspondence between contactome and connectome modules can be established using other clustering algorithms. For that we calculate the AMI score between the corresponding partitions, see Fig. S4 and Table S1. The maximal value of AMI score is achieved for 6 clusters, since the neurons from the other 4 clusters are missing in the contactome dataset. Indeed, as Fig. 6 shows, the clusters from 5 to 8 contain neurons that are left unassigned in both datasets of the contactome. Accordingly, at k = 6 the flow matrix yields connectome clusters that demonstrate the best quantitative agreement with the contactome modules among all the clustering methods (flow matrix: AMI = 0.51 for the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.47 for the Moyle et al.; IMMA algorithm: AMI = 0.4 for the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.43 for the Moyle et al.; ERMM algorithm: AMI = 0.41 for",
          "Figure 6: P-values of the overlaps between the non-backtracking flow clusters and contactome modules: (a) Brittin et al. stratas brittin2021multi or (b) Moyle et al. stratas moyle2021structural the Brittin et al. and AMI = 0.36 for the Moyle et al.). Furthermore, as Fig. S4 suggests, the flow matrix clusters appear to correspond better to the contactome modules than the normalized Laplacian and modularity clusters (e.g., the FM clusters overlap by more than 20% stronger with the contactome modules than the clusters produced by the other two spectral methods). This analysis highlights that the non-backtracking algorithm yields interpretable connectome communities that strongly overlap with the contactome modules derived from the neurite spatial contacts. The obtained non-backtracking communities correspond to the neurite contacts much better than the previously reported clusters of C.elegans connectome. Conclusion In this paper we performed a detailed analysis and demonstrated applicability of the spectrum of non-backtracking random walks to the problem of the structural connectome clustering on the model example of C.elegans. This clusterization method outperforms traditional clustering methods on simulated models in the regime of low density of connections, virtually circumventing the sparsity issue and related emergence of hubs. Our analysis of the C.elegans connectome has shown that already on a relatively small network size ( N = 279 ) the communities produced by the non-backtracking method – as compared to previously reported modules in the connectome – result in a better clustering quality and biological interpretability in the terms of functions and neurite spatial contacts. We applied the non-backtracking clustering scheme for two versions of the C.elegans connectome (old Chen2006wiring and new cook2019whole ). While in both datasets k = 10 isolated eigenvalues can be seen in the spectrum of the non-backtracking flow matrix, the detectability condition suggests that only in the new connectome all k = 10 clusters can be reliably detected (see Fig.2). Based on the complete C.elegans connectome cook2019whole , we reveal ten interpretable communities that we further classify into three distinct compartments: (i) four multifunctional head clusters full of ring neurons (’Worm Brain’); (ii) four clusters responsible for movements control in the head and tail halves of the worm (’Worm Movements Controller’); (iii) one cluster made up from the command interneurons and one cluster from the lateral ganglion consisting of sensory neurons and interneurons (’Worm Information Flow Connector’). Comparison with the recently mapped contactome modules reveals strong interpretability of the non-backtracking communities in terms of the neurite spatial contacts. We find that the ’Worm Brain’ compartment (clusters 1-4) consists of the neurons with axons that project into the anterior part of the nerve ring, while the ’Worm Information Flow Connector’ (clusters 9-10) compartment stores the amphid neurons that project axons into the posterior part of the worm head. Since the other ’Worm Movements Controller’ compartment (clusters 5-8) contains the neurons that are unclassified in the contactome, we conclude that contactome modules strongly reproduce the connectome clusters. Such a result supports Peter’s rule as a principle of synaptic specificity in the C.elegans brain. Broadly, our study highlights deep interconnections between anatomical locations (metric space embedding), mesoscopic structure (topological embedding) and biological functions of the neurons that determine behaviour of an organism. In order to derive these relationships accurately it is important to precisely resolve the topological modules in the connectome network. In the framework of the one of the simplest model organisms we demonstrate that the cluster analysis of the connectome should be performed by taking into account the intrinsic sparsity of the network, which is addressed by the non-backtracking operator informed by the corresponding detectability thresholds. Given", 
      "universality of our approach, we believe it can be further extended to connectomes of more complex organisms with larger networks, where the effect of sparsity would be even more dramatic. Methods Data We have worked with old and new open-access data from the C.elegans connectome analysis project Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and Cook SJ et al. paper cook2019whole . Both datasets are updated and revised versions of the wiring data originally published in white1986structure . Neuron interactions, locations, sensory endings, and neuromuscular junctions, as well as the structure of the connectome, have been well studied and have been found to be invariant with respect to the type of animal white1986structure ; hall1991posterior , however, there is now growing concern that the C.elegans connectome is not invariant yemini2021neuropal ; brittin2021multi ; witvliet2021connectomes . Connectome 3D model used for the reconstruction of cluster elements anatomical positions was taken from the Caltech Wormbase project harris2010wormbase . The two versions of the connectome (Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural and cook2019whole ) have significantly different number of edges: in the refined data of Cook SJ et al cook2019whole there is almost twice more synaptic contacts as compared to the BL Chen et al Chen2006wiring previous work ( 6334 vs 2990 ). The new hermaphrodite connectome from cook2019whole is a network with 302 vertices and 6334 edges: 1447 edges are formed by gap junctions only; 4887 contain only chemical synapses. The old hermaphrodite connectome Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural is a network with 302 vertices and 2990 edges: 796 edges are formed by gap junctions and 1962 contain only chemical synapses. The entire nervous system is broken down into two large disconnected components and two isolated neurons (CANL, CANR) and additionally the VC06 neuron is isolated in the old connectome data Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural . Twenty of the neurons in one of the components are located within the worm pharynx, which has its own separate nervous system, and the remaining 280 (or 279 for Chen2006wiring ; varshney2011structural ) neurons (excluding two isolated neurons) are located in various ganglia along the worm body. During the preprocessing stage, all connections in the connectome are made undirected and unweighted. Furthermore, we have divided the graph into two subgraphs according to contact types: chemical synapses or gap junctions and analyzed the connectome formed only by the synaptic contacts, because these two types of connections are fundamentally different in nature and their functions are also distinct. There is a large body of knowledge on individual neurons that produce node-wise features. In this work, we have used the classification of neurons into ten anatomically defined ganglia (posterolateral, ventral, pre-anal, lateral, dorsorectal, dorsal, retrovesicular, ventral cord, anterior and lumbar ganglia) and six functional groups (body motor neurons, head motor neurons, interneurons, sensory neurons, sex specific motor neurons, sublateral motor neurons) from altun2005handbook ; cook2019whole . As another benchmark for testing biological validity of our clusters, we have used the contactome adjacency matrices brittin2021multi ; moyle2021structural , because contactome itself contains information about axon position and metric structure of the C.elegans nervous system. Contactomes have fewer number of described neurons ( 170 neurons in the brittin2021multi stratas and 181 in the moyle2021structural ), therefore we added all missing neurons to the stratas Unassigned and Unclassified correspondingly. Full contactomes descriptions could be found on Google Spreadsheet. From stochastic block model to non-backtracking random walks One of the most popular methods for community detection (in particular, of the connectome pan2010mesoscopic ) is optimization of modularity. In fact, it can be shown that the generalized modularity functional provides the entropy of a Poisson weighted stochastic block model with quenched degrees (configuration model). Such models, for example, describe the results of single-cell contact counting experiments in chromatin networks, as was shown by us recently polovnikov20 . If the degrees of all vertices d i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j are kept fixed, without additional imposed cluster structure, the expected weight of the edge under random degree-preserving randomization is simply P i \u2062 j = d i \u2062 d j ∑ i d i for i ≠ j . Assuming that the stochastic blocks are superimposed over the configuration model, each entry A i \u2062 j of the adjacency matrix of the observed network becomes a Poisson random variable with the mean P i \u2062 j \u2062 w r \u2062 t , such that the nodes i and j are assigned to the groups G r and G t , respectively. Thus, the total statistical weight of A conditioned on the cluster probability matrix W , quenched degrees d i and group labels g i can be factorized into the product of the Poisson probabilities and written down as follows 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , d i , g i ) = ∏ i < j P i \u2062 j \u2062 w g i \u2062 g j A i \u2062 j A i \u2062 j ! \u2062 exp \u2061 ( − P i \u2062 j \u2062 w g i \u2062 g j ) (8)",
      "which produces the following entropy S c \u2062 o \u2062 n \u2062 f . ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , d i , g i ) = ∑ i < j ( A i \u2062 j − γ \u2062 P i \u2062 j ) \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (9) where γ is some parameter that depends on w i \u2062 n and w o \u2062 u \u2062 t of the planted SBM (1) as follows γ = w i \u2062 n − w o \u2062 u \u2062 t log \u2061 w i \u2062 n − log \u2061 w o \u2062 u \u2062 t (10) Clearly, the entropic functional (9) up to the parameter γ is nothing but the modularity functional, which is widely used in clustering tasks, for connectome clustering as well pan2010mesoscopic . It is important to note that generally the parameter γ have to be chosen self-consistently with the cluster parameters of the partition (10), for which the iterative procedure has been recently proposed polovnikov20 . Modularity optimization has been originally proposed and proved to be useful for clusterization of scale-free networks, since, as we have shown above, it explicitly conserves the scale-free property of the degree distribution under stochastic randomization. Although most of the real-world networks are scale-free, modularity is one of the most popular approaches in spectral clustering. However, if one relaxes the degrees preservation assumption, the background probability becomes uniform P i \u2062 j = p and the underlying graph is assumed to be simply a G \u2062 ( N , p ) Erdos-Renyi graph. Then the second term in (9) does not depend on cluster labels of the nodes, and maximization of the entropy for a given amount of clusters corresponds to maximization of the adjacency functional S E \u2062 R ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , g i ) = ∑ i < j A i \u2062 j \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (11) which is trying to maximize the internal weight of the clusters. In a more general problem setting of a manifold learning, one is looking for the optimal representation (embedding) of N vertices in a low-dimensional space described by a set of coordinates g i , i = 1 , 2 , … , N (suppose, the latent space is one-dimensional for simplicity). As long as close points in the original high-dimensional space should be eventually put close in the latent space, the natural functional to be minimized is S M \u2062 L ∝ log \u2061 𝒵 \u2062 ( A  W , g i ) = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i ≠ j A i \u2062 j \u2062 ( g i − g j ) 2 (12) which can be written as a quadratic form of the graph Laplacian, L = D − A S M \u2062 L ∝ ∑ i , j L i \u2062 j \u2062 g i \u2062 g j (13) Of course, a similar functional over latent coordinates can be written for the modularity functional (9) as well. Thus, we see that statistical inference of the optimal cluster structure is associated with optimization of a certain functional over partition of graph nodes. However, finding the global maximum of (9),(11),(13) is a very difficult computational task. To overcome this difficulty, spectral methods are used, which rely on the fact that the most essential information about the optimal partition is encoded in the first non-trivial eigenvectors of the corresponding operator. Indeed, the quadratic form associated with the manifold learning problem can be approximated by projecting the coordinates to the leading eigenvectors of the operator. Modularity matrix In newman2004finding the modularity matrix of a graph was defined as M := A − d \u2062 d T 2 \u2062 C , (14) where A is the adjacency matrix, d = ( d 1 , … , d n ) T is the degree-vector comprised of the vertices degrees and C = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i = 1 n d i is the total number of edges in the network.", 
      "We computed a quantitative measure of modularity for each partition of graphs into several communities, using the standard Newman’s modularity (Q value): Q := 1 2 \u2062 C \u2062 ∑ i , j ( A i , j − d i \u2062 d j ∑ i d i ) \u2062 δ g i \u2062 g j (15) By notation, A is the adjacency matrix of connectome ( A i \u2062 j = 1 , if neurons i , j are connected, and 0 , otherwise). The degree of each vertex i is given by d i = ∑ j A i \u2062 j . C is the total number of edges on the connectome graph, equal to C = 1 2 \u2062 ∑ i d i and δ is the Kronecker delta and g i is the label of the community to which vertex i is assigned. As we see, (15) is different from the entropic functional (9) by a particular normalization coefficient used. Laplacian and normalized Laplacian Laplacian is widely used in spectral manifold learning methods, a framework known as Laplacian Eigenmaps. The graph Laplacian matrix is defined as L := D − A , (16) where A is the adjacency and D is the diagonal matrix of degrees. Though Laplacian is related to many physical phenomena, such as heat propagation, a more direct connection with random walks is provided by the Normalized Laplacian (or Random Walks Laplacian), L R \u2062 W = D − 1 \u2062 L , which is also frequently used for clustering. Note that L R \u2062 W is non-symmetric, however, its spectrum is real. Obviously, L R \u2062 W has the same set of eigenvalues as the symmetric normalized Laplacian L n \u2062 o \u2062 r \u2062 m := D 1 / 2 \u2062 L R \u2062 W \u2062 D − 1 / 2 = D − 1 / 2 \u2062 L \u2062 D − 1 / 2 = I − D − 1 / 2 \u2062 A \u2062 D − 1 / 2 . (17) Similarity measures In order to assess the similarity between different partitions and biological benchmarks we use the adjusted mutual information score (AMI), defined as follows. Suppose that we have a set S and two partitions of S : U and V , the elements of the partitions are called clusters. Let us denote the probability that some random object falls into a cluster U i of U as P U \u2062 ( i ) which is equal to  U i   S  . The entropy calculated for the partition U is equal to H \u2062 ( U ) = − ∑ i = 1 R P U \u2062 ( i ) \u2062 log \u2061 P U \u2062 ( i ) . Using the introduced notation, we can express the mutual information for U and V as M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) := ∑ i = 1 R ∑ j = 1 C P U \u2062 V \u2062 ( i , j ) \u2062 log \u2061 P U \u2062 V \u2062 ( i , j ) P U \u2062 ( i ) \u2062 P V \u2062 ( j ) . (18) Importantly, this measure of similarity tends to be larger when the two partitions have a larger number of clusters even when we use the same number of elements for clustering. To avoid such biases one can use the adjusted mutual information which is defined as A \u2062 M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) := M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) − E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } max \u2061 { H \u2062 ( U ) , H \u2062 ( V ) } − E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } , (19) where E \u2062 { M \u2062 I \u2062 ( U , V ) } is the expected value of the mutual information of V and U . Therefore, AMI is 0 when the similarity is equal to its expected value under random permutation of the vertices between the groups and 1 for identical partitions.",

    'html' : 'Introduction Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A-165 (VEGFA165) is the isoform of VEGF that is primarily responsible for driving retinal vascular pathology in diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), through activation of VEGF Receptor-2 (VEGFR2). A seminal analysis of the vitreous fluids of patients with diabetic retinopathy established the presence of elevated VEGF concentrations associated with this and other conditions [1]. That study contributed to the eventual development of intravitreal VEGF-blocking drugs to treat neovascularization and edema in AMD, DR, and the current exploration of their use for ROP [2–5]. Blockade of VEGFA activity is provided by the use of intravitreal drugs including ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech), pegaptanib (Macugen, Bausch & Lomb), and aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron). Some VEGF-blocking drugs injected into the vitreous can enter the systemic circulation and, in the case of bevicizumab and aflibercept they can substantially decrease serum VEGF concentration for several days [6]. There is interest to advance VEGF-regulating therapies by more precise titration of VEGF concentration or modulating specific VEGF-mediated signalling rather than the full blockade provided by current drugs. This field will continue to benefit from a more complete knowledge of VEGF’s signaling mechanisms within retinal endothelial cells. Unfortunately, much previous VEGF research does not technically differentiate between VEGFA’s isoforms and in the case of the retina there is far less investigation using retinal endothelial cells, and even less from human retina. In addition to endothelial cells, VEGF receptors are expressed by cells of the immune system, including early and late hematopoietic progenitor cells, dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes and macrophages [7]. Among the three VEGF receptor tyrosine-kinases (R1, R2, R3), VEGFR2 is required for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and its expression is most abundant in endothelial and endothlial progenitor cells [8–10]. VEGFR2 binds several isoforms of the VEGFA that are produced from alternative-splicing [11–14]. The most frequently detected isoforms are VEGFA121, VEGFA165 and VEGFA189, with 121, 165 and 189 amino acids respectively. VEGFA121 is most diffusible, lacking the heparin-binding domains of VEGFA165 and VEGFA189. VEGFA189 has even more affinity for heparin than VEGFA165 with an additional heparin-binding domain encoded by exon-6 [11,12]. VEGFA165 bind as a dimer to activate VEGFR2, and it also binds Neuropilin-1 as a co-receptor. VEGFA121 lacks two regions required to binding Neuropilin-1. A vast knowledge of VEGF-mediated signalling is mostly derived from the study of non-retinal cell types, and is beyond the scope of this paper but readers can refer to the excellent review by Koch and Claesson-Welch [15]. In endothelial cells, several pathways are activated by VEGFA165 that affect proliferation, migration, survival and endothelial permeability. Two of these pathways include MAPK (ERK1/2) and the AKT (PKB), where MAPK is a dominant regulator of cell proliferation and AKT modulates cell survival and permeability [16–19]. Autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Y1175) leads to RAS-independent activation of the PLCγ (Phospholipase-Cγ) / Protein Kinase C / MAPK pathway [20,21]. Activation of VEGFR2 also leads to activation of the TSAD / PI3K (Phosphotidylinositol-3 Kinase) / PDK (Phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase) / AKT pathway [22,23]. AKT phosphorylates the BCL-2-associated death protein (BAB) and Caspase-9 to block apoptosis and increase EC-survival [24]. AKT also activates eNOS (endothelial Nitric-Oxide Synthase, NOS3) to modulate vascular permeability [25]. More recently b-isoforms of VEGFA were described that differ from the previously known a-isoforms in the sequence of their C-terminal six amino acids: CDKRPP in VEGFA165a becomes SLTRDKD in VEGFA165b [13,14]. This difference renders VEGFA165b incapable of bringing Neuropilin-1 into a receptor/ligand complex with VEGFR2 [26–28]. Similar to VEGFA121, VEGFA165b is reported to be less angiogenic than VEGFA165a [13,29,30]. VEGFA165b’s binding affinity for VEGFR2 itself is similar to that of VEGFA165a in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and less than VEGFA165a in direct binding anlaysis in transformed HEK293 cell assays [31,32]. VEGFA165b also displays weaker activation of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2 (MAPK) than VEGFA165a in transfected porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells [31]. Perrin et al. (2005), reported a switch from mostly VEGFA165b to mostly VEGFA165a in the vitreous of patients with active diabetic retinopathy [33]. A similar shift, from VEGFA165b to VEGFA165a, was reported in vitreous humor from young patients with ROP [34]. A murine equivalent of isoform switching (VEGFA164b to VEGFA164a) was also reported in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy [35]. Several publications using isoform specific antibodies have detected VEGFA165b in human and mouse tissues, but their presense from RNA analysis in sheep hypothalamus is controversial [36]. While single-dose studies using transfected cells or non-retinal endothelial cells indicate that VEGFA165b activates VEGFR2 and MAPK less than VEGFA165a, we do not know if this is true throughout a full dose range. We also wanted to determine full-dose response curves for activation of intracellular signaling in primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that there is a significant difference in the full dose-reponse curves for activation of these pathways in human retinal endothelial cells between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b. To address this, we used in situ assays to determined full dose-reponse curves for the activation of MAPK (ERK1/2), AKT and VEGFR2 in primary HRMECs for VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b. Our results demonstrate that there is a significant dose-response difference in the ability of these two isoforms to activate intracellular signalling kinases and that these dose-response differences propagate to differences in VEGF-target gene expression in primary human retinal endothelial cells. Methods Certification of Primary Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells Primary Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HRMECs, genotype XY) were obtained from Cell Systems as passage-3 cells (Kirkland, WA, Catalog number: ACBRI-181). Cells used for experimentation were not used past passage-7. Endothelial character of the cell line was established by Cell Systems immunofluorescence testing: > 95% positive by immunofluorescence for Cytoplasmic VWF / Factor VIII, Cytoplasmic uptake of Di-I-Ac-LDL, Cytoplasmic CD31, and < 1% by immunofluorescence for GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein), Glutamine Synthetase, NG2 (Neural/Glial Antigen 2), and PDGFR-beta (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor beta). The cell line was also subjected to short tandem repeat (STR) Profile Testing by Cell Systems at the Master Level (P1), performed by the laboratory analysis service of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Seventeen STR-loci plus the gender determining locus, Amelogenin, were amplified using the commercially available PowerPlex® 18D Kit from Promega. The cell line sample was processed using the ABI Prism® 3500xl Genetic Analyzer. Data were analyzed using the GeneMapper® IDX v1.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Appropriate positive and negative controls were used throughout the test procedure. DNA Profile (STR #12625 Analysis) was as follows: TH01: 9, 9.3; D5S818: 9, 13; D13S317: 8, 10; D7S820: 11, 12; D16S539: 11, 12; CSF1PO: 10, 12; Amelogenin: X, Y; vWA: 16, 19; TPOX: 8, 11. The ATCC test conclusions were that the submitted sample profile is human, but not a match any profile in the ATCC STR database, as would be expected for primary HRMECs. Additionally, routine testing for retinal endothelial character in the author’s laboratory (Eye Research Institute, Oakland University) confirmed that the HRMECs express all three of the human Norrin receptorcomplex genes FZD4, LRP5 and TSPAN12, using Taqman real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). HRMECs also demonstrated VEGF-medidated regulation of several VEGF target genes, as shown in the results. Cell Culture and Antibodies EndoGRO-MV Complete media kit was obtained from Millipore (Burlington, MA). EndoGro basal medium was supplemented with rhEGF, L-Glutamine, Heparin Sulfate and Ascorbic Acid according to the kit instructions. Additionally, supplementation with FBS and Hydrocortisone Hemisuccinate (1μg/ml) was dependent upon the assay requirements. Recombinant human VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Odyssey Blocking Buffer and an Odyssey Infrared Imager were purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). The antibodies used for in situ labeling of HMRECs (In Cell Westerns, ICW) and Western blotting are summarized in Table 1. Mini Protean TGX gels were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). View inlineView popup Table-1. Specific Antibodies used and Sources Immunoblotting of activated MAPK and AKT in HRMECs HRMECs were grown in 100mm dishes that had been pre-coated with Attachment Factor (Cell Systems, WA). Media was EndoGRO (No VEGF, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) with 5% FBS to establish confluency. When cells were confluent, the media was replaced with fresh media with or without VEGFA165 isoforms. After incubation for 10 minutes, the cells were washed with ice cold PBS and the dishes were scraped to detach the cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 X g for 5 minutes and the cells were reconstituted in RIPA cell-lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM Sodium Fluoride, 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate and complete Protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tablet/10 ml)). The cells were sonicated or vortexed every 10 minutes while kept on ice for 30 minutes. The cell lysate was collected after centrifuging at 14,000 X g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). The samples were prepared with Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto a (4-15%) gradient gels for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After electrophoresis the gels were equilibrated in cold transfer buffer and transferred to PDVF membranes overnight. The membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated with appropriates rabbit primary antibodies (Table-1) along with mouse monoclonal Actin antibody which was used for normalization. After washing with PBS, 0.1% tween-20 (4 × 5 min), the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Goat Anti-rabbit IRDye680 and Goat Anti-mouse IRDye800CW) for 30-60 minutes. Membranes were washed and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared imager (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Dose-response analysis of intracellular signaling in primary HMRECs HRMECs were seeded into black 96 well plates (5000/well) that had been coated with Attachment Factor. The cells were grown to confluence using fully supplemented EndoGRO-MV media for 4-5 days. The cells were serum starved overnight using EndoGRO-MV without Hydrocortisone. The cells were treated with VEGFA165a or VEGFA165b for varied lengths of time after which the treatments were immediately removed and replaced with of 4% Paraformaldehyde. The cells were fixed for 20 minutes at room temperature followed by permeabilization with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 minutes). Cells were blocked by incubation with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor) for 1.5 hours at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (1:200) for either 2 hours at room temperature or over night at 4 °C. Rabbit antibodies were used against the proteins of interest and a mouse monoclonal anti-Beta-Actin antibody was used for normalization. The cells were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (5×5 minutes) and incubated with secondary antibodies, Goat anti-Rabbit IRDye 800CW & Goat anti-Mouse IRDye 680RD (1:750) for 45 minutes at room temperature. After washing with PBS 0.1% Tween 20 (5×5 minutes) the plates were scanned on an Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor). For time-response and dose-response experiments, the doses of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b were assayed in quadruplicate wells and dose-response experiments were repeated three times to confirm reproducibility of relative dose-response curves for activation of MAPK (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204), AKT (phospho-Ser473) and VEGFR2 (phospho-Tyr1175). Data were fit to a 4-parameter log-logistic response function Eq (1) at the 95% confidence level for each dose x using the Drc package for R. [37]. The parameters fit were: b, the steepness of the curve at e the effective dose ED50, with c and d the lower and upper limits of the response. The 95% confidence level for fitting was used to produce curves. Quantitative PCR analysis of HMREC Gene Expression Primary HMRECs were grown to confluence in six well plates. After the desired treatment, cells were trypsinized. Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA miniprep kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Cells were homogenized in 200μL of lysis buffer. Homogenization was accomplished using conical pelletpestles in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, with a hand-held rotary tool (Bel-Art,Wayne, NJ). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing 500 ng of total RNA per sample using either the AffinityScript qPCR DNA Synthesis kit (Agilent), or the LunaScript RT Super Mix Kit (NEB # E3010(S/L), Ipswich, MA) with Oligo-dT priming. The reaction conditions were according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For AffinityScript: 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 20 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 10°C for 10 min. For LunaScript RT: 25°C for 2 min, 55°C for 10 min, and 95°C for 1 min. All compared samples were processed using the same reagent set. Stock first strand cDNA preparations were stored at −70°C, and were not used for analysis after a maximum of three freeze-thaws. Duplex reaction format was utilized with FAM-labeled probe/primer pairs for the gene of interest and VIC-labeled probe/primer-limited pairs for TBP (Tata-Binding Protein) as the normalizer gene (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). For real-time PCR reactions, sample first-strand cDNA was diluted 5-fold with deionized water and 2μL added to 18μL of master mix for 20μL PCR reactions. Triplicate reactions were used for each sample. Master Mix chemistries were either 2x Gene Expression Master Mix (ThermoFisher, Applied Biosystems # 4369016, Waltham, MA), or the Luna Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (2x) Gene Expression (New England BioLabs # M3004L, Ipswich, MA), both mixes with the Rox reference dye option. Reactions were run on either an Mx3000P real-time PCR system using the MxPro software, or an AriaMx Real-time PCR System using the AriaMx HRM QPCR Software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression assays were evaluated for high PCR efficiency using a dilution series of HMREC cDNA to ensure validity of using the delta-delta Ct method for comparing relative gene expression. Each replicate reaction was internally normalized relative to endogenous TBP gene expression.

ESULTS Preliminary observations The cell-based experimental results reported here were inspired by observations made during preliminary testing for a different project to develope an intravitreal injection model using VEGFA165a to cause dilation of primary retinal veins, which was reported to occur in the Long Evans rat [38]. That model typically involves a high dose of VEGFA. Using fluoresceine angiography, and SD-OCT imaging, it was noted that similar effects on the vasculature could be induced with VEGFA165b or VEGFA165a. While the observational studies did not use large numbers of rats, they are included as supplimental observations because they brought our attention that the dose-responses for intracellular pathway activation were not fully known in primary human retinal endothelial cells. Activation of MAPK and AKT in primary HRMECs by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b To examine the effect of VEGF165 isoforms on intracellular signaling pathways we chose primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and initially used immunoblotting to test activation of MAPK and AKT pathways by both isoforms. These pathways were examined as two of the intracellular signaling kinases implicated in mediating the effects of VEGFA on endothelial proliferation and blood-retinal barrier. Using a high dose (100 ng/mL, 5300 pM) for maximal activation, both isoforms of VEGFA165 increased the amounts of the active form of MAPK (Figure-1a) and the active form of AKT (Figure-1b). From three separate full experimental repeats, the average activation was about 2.7-fold and 1.6-fold (Figure-1c) for MAPK and AKT respectively. While VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b treatments always increased the activation of both kinases, the magnitude of the increase was variable between experiments as illustrated by comparing two of the three experiments on the same gel (Figure 1a,b).

Two representative experiments are shown. B) Immunoblots of total AKT and activated AKT (Phospho-AKT) 10 minutes after treatment with VEGFA165a (Va), VEGFA165b (Vb), or media control (C). Two representative experiments are shown. C) Fold activation of MAPK and AKT from three immunoblotting experiments. P-values are shown, t-test relative to media controls (1-fold). Dose-Response for the Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b While repeated immunoblotting experiments confirmed activation of MAPK and AKT by both VEGFA165 isoforms, the experimental variability introduced by protein extraction, protein assays, electro-transfer, band-shape and image analysis was judged to be unsuitable for dose-response analysis. To address the variability, new in situ assays, or In-Cell Western (ICW) assays, were developed using the same kinase-specific antibodies while removing the sample processing required for immunoblotting. This also permitted faster fixation of cells at the desired time, the use of many doses, and the use of several biological replicates per dose. Activation of the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway in primary HRMECs occurred maximally at 10 minutes for both VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b treatment, and returned to control levels by 90 minutes, using a dose of 2ng/mL (100 pM). See Figure-2a. The activation of VEFGA165a was significantly stronger than that of VEGFA165b at 10 minutes (t-test, P<0.01). Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 2. VEGFA165a strongly activates MAPK in primary HRMECs at doses where VEGFA165b has little effect. Activation of MAPK was measured by in-situ immunofluorescence with a phospho-specific antibody (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204) for p44/42. A) Activation of MAPK at three time-points after the addition of 100 pM VEGFA165a or VEGFA165b. Bar shows standard deviation.

Bars indicate the 95% confidence interval for data fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic function. N=4 biological replicates per dose. We next carried out dose-response analysis for the activation of the MAPK at 10 minutes with cells pre-adapated to lower serum. Eleven doses of each isoform, with 4 biological replicates per dose, were evaluated and dose-response data for MAPK activation were fit to the Log-Logistic 4-parameter dose-response function using the Drc package in R [37]. (Figure-2b) Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b showed a typical sigmoidal dose-response. Compared to VEGFA165b, the dose-response curve for VEGFA165a displayed a strong allosteric shift to a more binary-like activation response. VEGFA165a was more potent for activation of MAPK at lower doses. A similar maximum level of MAPK activation could be achieved with the highest dose tested (10,000 pM) using either isoform. Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b was only 10% of that generated by VEGFA165a using a dose of 250 pM. The ED50 was 73 pM for VEGFA165a and 1015 pM for VEGFA165b for the experiment shown. The experiment was repeated three times confirming the large difference in ED50 between the two isoforms. Differences between the ED50 values were typically in the 800 to 1000 pM range. Dose-Response for the Activation of AKT Activation by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b Maximum activation of the pAKT pathway in HRMECs occurred 30 minutes after VEGFA165a treatment and 15 minutes after VEGFA165b treatment (Figure-3a) using what was thought to be a maximally activating dose (100 ng/mL 5,300 pM). Dose response analysis was carried out for AKT activation using these respective maximum time points and the data were fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic response function. (Figure-3b). With VEGFA165a, AKT activation in HRMECs displayed a much steeper dose-response curve than for VEGFA165b. The ED50 values were 53 pM for VEGFA165a compared to 126 pM for VEGFA165b. The maximum activation of AKT generated by the b-isoform was less than half that obtained from treatment with the a-isoform. Repetition of the experiment confirmed similar relative responses.

Bar shows standard deviation. (t-test, ***p<0.001 relative to untreated control, n=4 biological replicates.) B) Dose response curves for activation of AKT.

N=4 biological replicates per dose. Dose-Response for the Activation of VEGFR2 by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b To test for relative difference in dose-response at the level of the receptor itself we examined the dose-response for activation of VEGFR2. Maximum activation of the receptor was fast, within less than a few minutes, as quickly as cells could be processed for treatment and fixation. Five and ten minute experiments were similar in relative response, so ten minutes were used for the dose-response experiments and data were fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic response function as shown in Figure-4a. VEGFA165a treatment achieved maximum activation by about 500 pM whereas VEGFA165b caused little if any activation at that dose. The ED50 for activation by VEGFA165a was 254 pM compared to 1192 pM for the VEGFA165b. Furthermore, the maximum activation by VEGFA165b was 73% of that obtained with VEGFA165a. Again, the relative pattern was confirmed by a repeated experiment (data not shown). Download figureOpen in new tab Figure 4. Differences in the activation of intracellular signalling between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b in primary HRMECs begin at the receptor VEGFR2. VEGFA165a was a stronger activator of VEGFR2 compared to VEGFA165b. The ED50 for activation by VEGFA165a was 254 pM compared to 1192 pM for VEGFA165b. Bars indicate the 95% confidence interval for data fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic function. N=4 biological replicates per dose. Isoform Effects on Expression Leukocyte Docking Protein Genes We first examined gene expression from 1 to 24 hours after treatment with high doses (100 ng/mL, 5300 pM) of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b to determine an optimal time-point for monitoring any effects on the expression of ICAM1, Selectin-E, and VCAM1. A dose of 5300 pM was likely a saturating concentration and more than what would be experienced in vivo, to find a suitable time-point where gene expression could be subsequently compared using physiologically relevant doses. All three of these genes displayed increased expression after treatment with both isoforms of VEGFA165 (Figure-5 a, c, e). These trends were confirmed by repeated experiments (data not shown). Of the genes examined here, ICAM1’s increasing expression trend was more variable in timing, not always maximum at 6 hours, sometimes later by 24 hours (data not shown).

For all three leukocyte docking protein genes (ICAM1, SELE, VCAM1), VEGFA165a increased their expression at the intermediate dose of 1000 pM where VEGFA165b still had very little effect (Figure-5 b, d, f). Isoform Effects on Expression of Tight Junction Protein Genes The effects of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b on the expression of the two key tight-junction protein genes, CLDNS and OCLN, were also compared.

Anova: compared to media control *p<0.05, **p<0.01; compared to VEGFA165a †† p<0.01) DISCUSSION While the role of VEGFA in vascular development, tumorgenesis and hypoxia has been studied for almost three decades, less is known about the functional differences between VEGFA isoforms. More recently, isoform-specific analysis reported that most VEGFA165 in normal vitreous was VEGFA165b, with the ratio changing to mostly VEGFA165a in eyes with active diabetic retinopathy and ROP [33,34]. The relative expression of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b can be regulated by alternative splicing of the VEGFA165 pre-mRNA, which is regulated by phosphorylation of the ASF/SF2 splice-factor by SR-protein kinase (SRPK1/2) [39]. This raised the possibility that modulation of this isoform ratio might be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Modulation of the splicing between the VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b mRNAs was demonstrated using SRPK inhibitors in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and topical infusion of these inhibitors reduced neovasularization in a mouse laser-induced CNV model [40]. Another group used intravitreal injection of a different SRPK inhibitor to inhibit neovascularization in the mouse CNV model [41]. An antibody specific for the C-terminus of VEGFA165a, which does not bind VEGFA165b, can also inhibit the proangiogenic effects of VEGFA165a [42]. Specific blockade of the VEGFA165a protein, or supressing VEGFA165a expression in favor of VEGFA165b, could be a therapeutic strategy if there are significant differences in the ability of these isoforms to activate intracellular signalling in the retinal endothelium. The preference for examining signaling differences using primary HRMECs is supported by studies that revealed differences between endothelial cells derived from different organs. For example, viral delivery of a murine recombinant-VEGF164b attenuated inflammatory-response damage in a murine model of ulcerative colitis, yet it exacerbated blood-brain-barrier damage in a model of focal cerebral ischemia [43-45]. Extensive gene expression profiling has also demonstrated that HUVECs have a greater expression of embryonic genes, and other differences, compared to endothelial cells from the choroid and neural retina. Significant differences also exist between human retinal endothelial cells and human choroidal endothelial cells in the expression of genes that are related to endothelial function and neovascularization [46]. We began with immunoblotting to examine the activation of MAPK and AKT in primary HRMECs. While VEGFA165b does not bind the Neuropilin-1 co-receptor, it does bind to VEGFR2 with similar or less affinity as VEGFA165a depending on the cell model and method used [31,32]. Irregardless of relative binding affinity, VEGFA165b is reported to bind and activate VEGFR2 based on immunoblotting studies [31,47,48]. Using immunoblotting, we found that both MAPK and AKT were activated to a similar extent by VEGFAM165a or VEGFA165b, using a dose of 100 ng/ml (5,300 pM) in primary HRMECs. Previous single-dose immunoblotting studies in different cell-types have reported that VEGFA165b activated VEGFR2 and MAPK less than VEGFA165a, and that the maximum activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b occurred later than VEGFA165a in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) and bovine aortic endothelial cells using a dose of 2,600 pM [31,47]. Another study of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) found that the a-isoform was a stronger activator of VEGFR2 and MAPK (ERK1/2) than the b-isoform at a dose of 20 ng/ml (1000 pM) [48]. We found that both MAPK and AKT were activated less by VEGFA165b at the lower dose (20 ng/ml, 1000 pM) (data not shown). However, it was noted that while activation was detected in repeated experiments, the relative manitude of activation was variable using immunoblotting. Immunublotting does involvenumerous processing steps and a subtantial number of cells are required for a single sample, therefore we decided that in situ assays would be supperior for generating full dose-response curve data. To determine the dose-response for activation of MAPK and AKT, in situ ICW assays were developed that permited the use of multiple replicate doses with a limited supply of primary cells in a 96 well plate format. The resulting dose-response curves confirmed that there were substantial differences in the activation of both MAPK and AKT between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b in primary HRMECs. In the case of MAPK, the ED50 of VEGFA165a 900 pM less than the ED50 for VEGFA165b. VEGFA165a caused near maximal activation of MAPK at a concentration of 250 pM, whileVEGFA165b had little effect at 250 pM. Higher doses of VEGFA165b could activate MAPK to a similar maximum level, and the timing for maximum activation of MAPK was similar for both isoforms in HRMECs, occuring by 10 minutes and decreasing by 30 minutes. This relative timing was different from that reported for HUVECs where the maximum concentration of active MAPK occured 30 minutes after treatment with VEGFA165b [31]. For AKT, the difference in ED50 between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b was not as large as seen for MAPK, just two-fold greater for VEGFA165b compared to VEGFA165a. However, the activation of AKT by VEGFA165b was subtanially less than from VEGFA165a over the entire dose-response range. In contrast to MAPK activation, the time to maximum activation of AKT was earlier with VEGFA165b (15 minutes) compared to the VEGFA165a (30 minutes). While the differences in ED50 values were not as large as seen for MAPK activation, the maximum activation of AKT obtained with VEGFA165b was only 50% of the maximum activation generated by VEGFA165a. This was another difference from that reported in a non-retinal endothelial celltype, human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPECs), whereAKT activation is the same for VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b at a dose of 20 ng/ml (1000pM) in HPECs [48]. The differences noted above in the activation of MAPK and AKT between HRMECs and non-retinal endothelial cells suggest that VEGF-mediated intracellular signaling patterns are not completely universal between endothelial cells from different organs. An evaluation of primary endothelial cells from the human retina should be utilized whenever possible to study the retinal context. Altogether, our dose-response curves for the activation of VEGFR2, MAPK, and AKT in primary HRMECs were consistent with the model proposed by Whitaker et al. (2001), wherein VEGFA165a activates VEGFR2 more intensely when it can bind the co-receptor Neuropilin-1, to form a larger activation complex [49]. Based on the primary HRMEC dose-response data for MAPK activation, VEGFA165a was more potent for activating intracellular signalling than VEGFA165b at lower doses, which fall into a range of total VEGFA165a concentrations previously reported in human vitreous. Vitreous concentrations for VEGFA have been measured by various techniques in several disease conditions. Most elevated VEGFA is the VEGFA165 isoform, which diffuses slowly, and the vitreous has protease activity, therefore it is possible that the concentrations measured in the vitreous are somewhat lower than in the neural retina itself. With that stated, vitreal concentrations of 25 pM to over 400 pM have been reported for proliferative diabetic retinopathy from several studies [1,50–54]. Other studies have reported 10 pM in diabetic macular edema [55], 100 to 450 pM in retinopathy of prematurity [34,56] and an average of 430 pM, with as high as 580 pM, in central retinal vein occlusion [57]. It is possible that elevations of retinal VEGFA165a concentration to several-hundred pico-Molar could increase the activation of endothelial intracellular signalling above its normal baseline. In contrast, the much lower activation potential of VEGFA165b in this concentration range would leave MAPK activation close to normal if most of the VEGFA165 existed as the b-isoform. We also found that VEGFA165b could affect the expression of the same target genes that are also regulated by VEGFA165a in primary HRMECs. These included genes involved in leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and tight-junction formation. Even though the 5,000 pM dose of VEGFA165b could activate MAPK and AKT more strongly than the intermediate 1,000 pM dose, it is unlikely that the 5,000 pM concentration would be experienced in vivo. For that reason we suggest that the effects on gene expression at 1,000 pM were most informative. We found that the CLDN5 gene was particulary succeptible to repression by both isoforms of VEGFA165 compared to OCLN in this cell type. VEGFA-mediated activation of the VEGFR2 receptor is known to disrupt adherin-junctions and causes ß-Catenin mediated repression of Claudin-5 gene expression in endothelial cells [58]. For all three leukocyte docking protein genes (ICAM1, SELE, VCAM1), VEGFA165a increased their expression at the intermediate dose of 1000 pM where VEGFA165b had less effect. We concluded that there were significant dose-response differences in the regulation of VEGFA-target genes, with VEGFA165a proving to be the stronger affector of gene expression overall. Summary Our results indicated that differences in the last 6 amino acids between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b have a significant affect on the relative activation of MAPK and AKT within primary HRMECs. VEGFA165a activated both pathways at lower concentrations where VEGF165b had little effect. The greater potential of VEGFA165a to affect HRMECs also extended to changes in the expression of genes required for leukocyte-docking and tight-junction structure. Large dose-response differences in activation of these pathways exist in ranges of elevated VEGFA165a concentrations that have been reported in the vitreous of diseased eyes. Key aspects of MAPK and AKT activation, such as timing and maximal activation, were different in HRMECs compared to those reported for some other non-retinal endothelial cell-types. These results would support the concept that specific blockade of VEGFA165a, or modulating the VEGFA165b / VEGFA165a ratio, could be useful thereapeutic strategies for retinal diseases involving elevated VEGFA concentration.',

        "Introduction Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A-165 (VEGFA165) is the isoform of VEGF that is primarily responsible for driving retinal vascular pathology in diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), through activation of VEGF Receptor-2 (VEGFR2). A seminal analysis of the vitreous fluids of patients with diabetic retinopathy established the presence of elevated VEGF concentrations associated with this and other conditions [1]. That study contributed to the eventual development of intravitreal VEGF-blocking drugs to treat neovascularization and edema in AMD, DR, and the current exploration of their use for ROP [2–5]. Blockade of VEGFA activity is provided by the use of intravitreal drugs including ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech), pegaptanib (Macugen, Bausch & Lomb), and aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron). Some VEGF-blocking drugs injected into the vitreous can enter the systemic circulation and, in the case of bevicizumab and aflibercept they can substantially decrease serum VEGF concentration for several days [6]. There is interest to advance VEGF-regulating therapies by more precise titration of VEGF concentration or", 
               "modulating specific VEGF-mediated signalling rather than the full blockade provided by current drugs. This field will continue to benefit from a more complete knowledge of VEGF’s signaling mechanisms within retinal endothelial cells. Unfortunately, much previous VEGF research does not technically differentiate between VEGFA’s isoforms and in the case of the retina there is far less investigation using retinal endothelial cells, and even less from human retina. In addition to endothelial cells, VEGF receptors are expressed by cells of the immune system, including early and late hematopoietic progenitor cells, dendritic cells, T-lymphocytes and macrophages [7]. Among the three VEGF receptor tyrosine-kinases (R1, R2, R3), VEGFR2 is required for angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, and its expression is most abundant in endothelial and endothlial progenitor cells [8–10]. VEGFR2 binds several isoforms of the VEGFA that are produced from alternative-splicing [11–14]. The most frequently detected isoforms are VEGFA121, VEGFA165 and VEGFA189, with 121, 165 and 189 amino acids respectively. VEGFA121 is most diffusible, lacking the heparin-binding domains of VEGFA165 and VEGFA189. VEGFA189 has even more affinity for heparin than VEGFA165 with an additional heparin-binding domain encoded by exon-6 [11,12]. VEGFA165 bind as a dimer to activate VEGFR2, and it also binds Neuropilin-1 as a co-receptor. VEGFA121 lacks two regions required to binding Neuropilin-1. A vast knowledge of VEGF-mediated signalling is mostly derived from the study of non-retinal cell types, and is beyond the scope of this paper but readers can refer to the excellent review by Koch and Claesson-Welch [15]. In endothelial cells, several pathways are activated by VEGFA165 that affect proliferation, migration, survival and endothelial permeability. Two of", 
               "these pathways include MAPK (ERK1/2) and the AKT (PKB), where MAPK is a dominant regulator of cell proliferation and AKT modulates cell survival and permeability [16–19]. Autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Y1175) leads to RAS-independent activation of the PLCγ (Phospholipase-Cγ) / Protein Kinase C / MAPK pathway [20,21]. Activation of VEGFR2 also leads to activation of the TSAD / PI3K (Phosphotidylinositol-3 Kinase) / PDK (Phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase) / AKT pathway [22,23]. AKT phosphorylates the BCL-2-associated death protein (BAB) and Caspase-9 to block apoptosis and increase EC-survival [24]. AKT also activates eNOS (endothelial Nitric-Oxide Synthase, NOS3) to modulate vascular permeability [25]. More recently b-isoforms of VEGFA were described that differ from the previously known a-isoforms in the sequence of their C-terminal six amino acids: CDKRPP in VEGFA165a becomes SLTRDKD in VEGFA165b [13,14]. This difference renders VEGFA165b incapable of bringing Neuropilin-1 into a receptor/ligand complex with VEGFR2 [26–28]. Similar to VEGFA121, VEGFA165b is reported to be less angiogenic than VEGFA165a [13,29,30]. VEGFA165b’s binding affinity for VEGFR2 itself is similar to that of VEGFA165a in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) and less than VEGFA165a in direct binding anlaysis in transformed HEK293 cell assays [31,32]. VEGFA165b also displays weaker activation of VEGFR2 and ERK1/2 (MAPK) than VEGFA165a in transfected porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells [31]. Perrin et al. (2005), reported a switch from mostly VEGFA165b to mostly VEGFA165a in the vitreous of patients with active diabetic retinopathy [33]. A similar shift, from VEGFA165b to VEGFA165a, was reported in vitreous humor from young patients with ROP [34]. A murine equivalent of isoform switching (VEGFA164b to VEGFA164a) was also reported in a mouse model", 
               "of oxygen-induced retinopathy [35]. Several publications using isoform specific antibodies have detected VEGFA165b in human and mouse tissues, but their presense from RNA analysis in sheep hypothalamus is controversial [36]. While single-dose studies using transfected cells or non-retinal endothelial cells indicate that VEGFA165b activates VEGFR2 and MAPK less than VEGFA165a, we do not know if this is true throughout a full dose range. We also wanted to determine full-dose response curves for activation of intracellular signaling in primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that there is a significant difference in the full dose-reponse curves for activation of these pathways in human retinal endothelial cells between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b. To address this, we used in situ assays to determined full dose-reponse curves for the activation of MAPK (ERK1/2), AKT and VEGFR2 in primary HRMECs for VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b. Our results demonstrate that there is a significant dose-response difference in the ability of these two isoforms to activate intracellular signalling kinases and that these dose-response differences propagate to differences in VEGF-target gene expression in primary human retinal endothelial cells. Methods Certification of Primary Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells Primary Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HRMECs, genotype XY) were obtained from Cell Systems as passage-3 cells (Kirkland, WA, Catalog number: ACBRI-181). Cells used for experimentation were not used past passage-7. Endothelial character of the cell line was established by Cell Systems immunofluorescence testing: > 95% positive by immunofluorescence", 
               "for Cytoplasmic VWF / Factor VIII, Cytoplasmic uptake of Di-I-Ac-LDL, Cytoplasmic CD31, and < 1% by immunofluorescence for GFAP (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein), Glutamine Synthetase, NG2 (Neural/Glial Antigen 2), and PDGFR-beta (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor beta). The cell line was also subjected to short tandem repeat (STR) Profile Testing by Cell Systems at the Master Level (P1), performed by the laboratory analysis service of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Seventeen STR-loci plus the gender determining locus, Amelogenin, were amplified using the commercially available PowerPlex® 18D Kit from Promega. The cell line sample was processed using the ABI Prism® 3500xl Genetic Analyzer. Data were analyzed using the GeneMapper® IDX v1.2 software (Applied Biosystems). Appropriate positive and negative controls were used throughout the test procedure. DNA Profile (STR #12625 Analysis) was as follows: TH01: 9, 9.3; D5S818: 9, 13; D13S317: 8, 10; D7S820: 11, 12; D16S539: 11, 12; CSF1PO: 10, 12; Amelogenin: X, Y; vWA: 16, 19; TPOX: 8, 11. The ATCC test conclusions were that the submitted sample profile is human, but not a match any profile in the ATCC STR database, as would be expected for primary HRMECs. Additionally, routine testing for retinal endothelial character in the author’s laboratory (Eye Research Institute, Oakland University) confirmed that the HRMECs express all three of the human Norrin receptorcomplex genes FZD4, LRP5 and TSPAN12, using Taqman real-time PCR analysis (data not shown). HRMECs also demonstrated VEGF-medidated regulation of several VEGF target genes, as shown in the results. Cell Culture and Antibodies EndoGRO-MV Complete media kit was obtained from Millipore (Burlington, MA). EndoGro basal medium was supplemented with rhEGF, L-Glutamine, Heparin Sulfate and Ascorbic Acid according to the kit instructions. Additionally,", 
               "supplementation with FBS and Hydrocortisone Hemisuccinate (1μg/ml) was dependent upon the assay requirements. Recombinant human VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Odyssey Blocking Buffer and an Odyssey Infrared Imager were purchased from LI-COR Biosciences (Lincoln, NE). The antibodies used for in situ labeling of HMRECs (In Cell Westerns, ICW) and Western blotting are summarized in Table 1. Mini Protean TGX gels were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). View inlineView popup Table-1. Specific Antibodies used and Sources Immunoblotting of activated MAPK and AKT in HRMECs HRMECs were grown in 100mm dishes that had been pre-coated with Attachment Factor (Cell Systems, WA). Media was EndoGRO (No VEGF, Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA) with 5% FBS to establish confluency. When cells were confluent, the media was replaced with fresh media with or without VEGFA165 isoforms. After incubation for 10 minutes, the cells were washed with ice cold PBS and the dishes were scraped to detach the cells. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 X g for 5", 
               "minutes and the cells were reconstituted in RIPA cell-lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM Sodium Fluoride, 1 mM Sodium Orthovanadate and complete Protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tablet/10 ml)). The cells were sonicated or vortexed every 10 minutes while kept on ice for 30 minutes. The cell lysate was collected after centrifuging at 14,000 X g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The protein concentration was measured using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific). The samples were prepared with Laemmli sample buffer and loaded onto a (4-15%) gradient gels for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After electrophoresis the gels were equilibrated in cold transfer buffer and transferred to PDVF membranes overnight. The membranes were blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer and incubated with appropriates rabbit primary antibodies (Table-1) along with mouse monoclonal Actin antibody which was used for normalization. After washing with PBS, 0.1% tween-20 (4 × 5 min), the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (Goat Anti-rabbit IRDye680 and Goat Anti-mouse IRDye800CW) for 30-60 minutes. Membranes were washed and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared imager (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Dose-response analysis of intracellular signaling in primary HMRECs HRMECs were seeded into black 96 well plates (5000/well) that had been coated with Attachment Factor. The cells were grown to confluence using fully supplemented EndoGRO-MV media for 4-5 days. The cells were serum starved overnight using EndoGRO-MV without Hydrocortisone. The cells were treated with VEGFA165a or VEGFA165b for varied lengths of time after which the treatments were immediately removed and replaced with of 4% Paraformaldehyde. The cells were fixed for 20 minutes at room temperature followed by permeabilization with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 minutes). Cells were blocked by incubation with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Li-Cor) for 1.5 hours", 
               "at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies (1:200) for either 2 hours at room temperature or over night at 4 °C. Rabbit antibodies were used against the proteins of interest and a mouse monoclonal anti-Beta-Actin antibody was used for normalization. The cells were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (5×5 minutes) and incubated with secondary antibodies, Goat anti-Rabbit IRDye 800CW & Goat anti-Mouse IRDye 680RD (1:750) for 45 minutes at room temperature. After washing with PBS 0.1% Tween 20 (5×5 minutes) the plates were scanned on an Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor). For time-response and dose-response experiments, the doses of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b were assayed in quadruplicate wells and dose-response experiments were repeated three times to confirm reproducibility of relative dose-response curves for activation of MAPK (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204), AKT (phospho-Ser473) and VEGFR2 (phospho-Tyr1175). Data were fit to a 4-parameter log-logistic response function Eq (1) at the 95% confidence level for each dose x using the Drc package for R. [37]. The parameters fit were: b, the steepness of the curve at e the effective dose ED50, with c and d the lower and upper limits of the response. The 95% confidence level for fitting was used to produce curves. Quantitative PCR analysis of HMREC Gene Expression Primary HMRECs were grown to confluence in six well plates. After the desired treatment, cells were trypsinized. Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA miniprep kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Cells were homogenized in 200μL of lysis buffer. Homogenization was accomplished using conical pelletpestles in 1.5 mL microfuge tubes, with a hand-held rotary tool (Bel-Art,Wayne, NJ). First-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing 500 ng of total RNA per sample using either the",
               "AffinityScript qPCR DNA Synthesis kit (Agilent), or the LunaScript RT Super Mix Kit (NEB # E3010(S/L), Ipswich, MA) with Oligo-dT priming. The reaction conditions were according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For AffinityScript: 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for 20 min, 95°C for 5 min, and 10°C for 10 min. For LunaScript RT: 25°C for 2 min, 55°C for 10 min, and 95°C for 1 min. All compared samples were processed using the same reagent set. Stock first strand cDNA preparations were stored at −70°C, and were not used for analysis after a maximum of three freeze-thaws. Duplex reaction format was utilized with FAM-labeled probe/primer pairs for the gene of interest and VIC-labeled probe/primer-limited pairs for TBP (Tata-Binding Protein) as the normalizer gene (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). For real-time PCR reactions, sample first-strand cDNA was diluted 5-fold with deionized water and 2μL added to 18μL of master mix for 20μL PCR reactions. Triplicate reactions were used for each sample. Master Mix chemistries were either 2x Gene Expression Master Mix (ThermoFisher, Applied Biosystems # 4369016, Waltham, MA), or the Luna Universal Probe qPCR Master Mix (2x) Gene Expression (New England BioLabs # M3004L, Ipswich, MA), both mixes with the Rox reference dye option. Reactions were run on either an Mx3000P real-time PCR system using the MxPro software, or an AriaMx Real-time PCR System using the AriaMx HRM QPCR Software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Gene expression assays were evaluated for high PCR efficiency using a dilution series of HMREC cDNA to ensure validity of using the delta-delta Ct method for comparing relative gene expression. Each replicate reaction was internally normalized relative to endogenous TBP gene expression. The specific assay probe sets used for gene expression analysis are listed in Table 2",

ESULTS Preliminary observations The cell-based experimental results reported here were inspired by observations made during preliminary testing for a different project to develope an intravitreal injection model using VEGFA165a to cause dilation of primary retinal veins, which was reported to occur in the Long Evans rat [38]. That model typically involves a high dose of VEGFA. Using fluoresceine angiography, and SD-OCT imaging, it was noted that similar effects on the vasculature could be induced with VEGFA165b or VEGFA165a. While the observational studies did not use large numbers of rats, they are included as supplimental observations because they brought our attention that the dose-responses for intracellular pathway activation were not fully known in primary human retinal endothelial cells. Activation of MAPK and AKT in primary HRMECs by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b To examine the effect of VEGF165 isoforms on intracellular signaling pathways we chose primary human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and initially used immunoblotting to", 
               "test activation of MAPK and AKT pathways by both isoforms. These pathways were examined as two of the intracellular signaling kinases implicated in mediating the effects of VEGFA on endothelial proliferation and blood-retinal barrier. Using a high dose (100 ng/mL, 5300 pM) for maximal activation, both isoforms of VEGFA165 increased the amounts of the active form of MAPK (Figure-1a) and the active form of AKT (Figure-1b). From three separate full experimental repeats, the average activation was about 2.7-fold and 1.6-fold (Figure-1c) for MAPK and AKT respectively. While VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b treatments always increased the activation of both kinases, the magnitude of the increase was variable between experiments as illustrated by comparing two of the three experiments on the same gel (Figure 1a,b).

Dose-Response for the Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b While repeated immunoblotting experiments confirmed activation of MAPK and AKT by both VEGFA165 isoforms, the experimental variability introduced by protein extraction, protein assays, electro-transfer, band-shape and image analysis was judged to be unsuitable for dose-response analysis. To address the variability, new in situ assays, or In-Cell Western (ICW) assays, were developed using the same kinase-specific antibodies while removing the sample processing required for immunoblotting. This also permitted faster fixation of cells at the desired time, the use of many doses, and the use of several biological replicates per dose. Activation of the MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway in primary HRMECs occurred maximally at 10 minutes for both VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b treatment, and returned to control levels by 90 minutes, using a dose of 2ng/mL (100 pM). See Figure-2a. The activation of VEFGA165a was significantly stronger than that of VEGFA165b at 10 minutes (t-test, P<0.01).",

We next carried out dose-response analysis for the activation of the MAPK at 10 minutes with cells pre-adapated to lower serum. Eleven doses of each isoform, with 4 biological replicates per dose, were evaluated and dose-response data for MAPK activation were fit to the Log-Logistic 4-parameter dose-response function using the Drc package in R [37]. (Figure-2b) Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b showed a typical sigmoidal dose-response. Compared to VEGFA165b, the dose-response curve for VEGFA165a displayed a strong allosteric shift to a more binary-like activation response. VEGFA165a was more potent for activation of MAPK at lower doses. A similar maximum level of MAPK activation could be achieved with the highest dose tested (10,000 pM) using either isoform. Activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b was only 10% of that generated by VEGFA165a using a dose of 250 pM. The ED50 was 73 pM for VEGFA165a and 1015 pM for VEGFA165b for the experiment shown. The experiment was repeated three times confirming the large difference in ED50 between the two isoforms. Differences between the ED50 values were typically in the 800 to 1000 pM range. Dose-Response for the Activation of AKT Activation by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b Maximum activation of the pAKT pathway in HRMECs occurred 30 minutes after VEGFA165a treatment and 15 minutes after VEGFA165b treatment (Figure-3a) using what was thought to be a maximally activating dose (100 ng/mL 5,300 pM). Dose response analysis was carried out for AKT activation using these respective maximum time points and the data were fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic response function. (Figure-3b).

Dose-Response for the Activation of VEGFR2 by VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b To test for relative difference in dose-response at the level of the receptor itself we examined the dose-response for activation of VEGFR2. Maximum activation of the receptor was fast, within less than a few minutes, as quickly as cells could be processed for treatment and fixation. Five and ten minute experiments were similar in relative response, so ten minutes were used for the dose-response experiments and data were fit to the 4-parameter log-logistic response function as shown in Figure-4a. VEGFA165a treatment achieved maximum activation by about 500 pM whereas VEGFA165b caused little if any activation at that dose. The ED50 for activation by VEGFA165a was 254 pM compared to 1192 pM for the VEGFA165b. Furthermore, the maximum activation by VEGFA165b was 73% of that obtained with VEGFA165a.

Isoform Effects on Expression Leukocyte Docking Protein Genes We first examined gene expression from 1 to 24 hours after treatment with high doses (100 ng/mL, 5300 pM) of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b to determine an optimal time-point for monitoring any effects on the expression of ICAM1, Selectin-E, and VCAM1. A dose of 5300 pM was likely a saturating concentration and more than what would be experienced in vivo, to find a suitable time-point where gene expression could be subsequently compared using physiologically relevant doses. All three of these genes displayed increased expression after treatment with both isoforms of VEGFA165 (Figure-5 a, c, e). These trends were confirmed by repeated experiments",

For all three leukocyte docking protein genes (ICAM1, SELE, VCAM1), VEGFA165a increased their expression at the intermediate dose of 1000 pM where VEGFA165b still had very little effect (Figure-5 b, d, f). Isoform Effects on Expression of Tight Junction Protein Genes The effects of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b on the expression of the two key tight-junction protein genes, CLDNS and OCLN, were also compared.

More recently, isoform-specific analysis reported that most VEGFA165 in normal vitreous was VEGFA165b, with the ratio changing to mostly VEGFA165a in eyes with active diabetic retinopathy and ROP [33,34]. The relative expression of VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b can be regulated by alternative splicing of the VEGFA165 pre-mRNA, which is regulated by phosphorylation of the ASF/SF2 splice-factor by SR-protein kinase (SRPK1/2) [39]. This raised the possibility that modulation of this isoform ratio might be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Modulation of the splicing between the VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b mRNAs was demonstrated using SRPK inhibitors in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and topical infusion of these inhibitors reduced neovasularization in a mouse laser-induced CNV model [40]. Another group used intravitreal injection of a different SRPK inhibitor to inhibit neovascularization in the mouse CNV model [41]. An antibody specific for the C-terminus of VEGFA165a, which does not bind VEGFA165b, can also inhibit the proangiogenic effects of VEGFA165a [42]. Specific blockade of the VEGFA165a protein, or supressing VEGFA165a expression in favor of VEGFA165b, could be a therapeutic strategy if there are significant differences in the ability of these isoforms to activate intracellular signalling in the retinal endothelium. The preference for examining signaling differences using primary HRMECs is supported by studies that revealed differences between endothelial cells derived from different organs. For example, viral delivery of a murine recombinant-VEGF164b attenuated inflammatory-response damage in a murine model of ulcerative colitis, yet it exacerbated blood-brain-barrier damage in a model of", 
               "focal cerebral ischemia [43-45]. Extensive gene expression profiling has also demonstrated that HUVECs have a greater expression of embryonic genes, and other differences, compared to endothelial cells from the choroid and neural retina. Significant differences also exist between human retinal endothelial cells and human choroidal endothelial cells in the expression of genes that are related to endothelial function and neovascularization [46]. We began with immunoblotting to examine the activation of MAPK and AKT in primary HRMECs. While VEGFA165b does not bind the Neuropilin-1 co-receptor, it does bind to VEGFR2 with similar or less affinity as VEGFA165a depending on the cell model and method used [31,32]. Irregardless of relative binding affinity, VEGFA165b is reported to bind and activate VEGFR2 based on immunoblotting studies [31,47,48]. Using immunoblotting, we found that both MAPK and AKT were activated to a similar extent by VEGFAM165a or VEGFA165b, using a dose of 100 ng/ml (5,300 pM) in primary HRMECs. Previous single-dose immunoblotting studies in different cell-types have reported that VEGFA165b activated VEGFR2 and MAPK less than VEGFA165a, and that the maximum activation of MAPK by VEGFA165b occurred later than VEGFA165a in porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) and bovine aortic endothelial cells using a dose of 2,600 pM [31,47]. Another study of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) found that the a-isoform was a stronger activator of VEGFR2 and MAPK (ERK1/2) than the b-isoform at a dose of 20 ng/ml (1000 pM) [48]. We found that both MAPK and AKT were activated less by VEGFA165b at the lower dose (20 ng/ml, 1000 pM) (data not shown). However, it was noted that while activation was detected in repeated experiments, the relative manitude of activation was variable using immunoblotting. Immunublotting does involvenumerous processing steps and a subtantial number of cells are required for a single sample, therefore we decided that in situ assays would be supperior for generating full dose-response curve data. To determine the dose-response for activation of MAPK and AKT, in situ ICW assays were developed that permited the use of multiple replicate doses with a limited supply of primary cells in a 96 well plate format. The resulting dose-response curves confirmed that there were substantial differences in the activation of both MAPK and AKT between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b in primary HRMECs. In the case of MAPK, the ED50 of VEGFA165a 900 pM less than the ED50 for VEGFA165b. VEGFA165a caused near maximal activation of MAPK at a concentration of 250 pM, whileVEGFA165b had little effect at 250 pM. Higher doses of VEGFA165b could activate MAPK to a similar maximum level, and the timing for maximum activation of MAPK was similar for both isoforms in HRMECs, occuring by 10 minutes and decreasing by 30 minutes. This relative timing was different from that reported for HUVECs where the maximum concentration of active MAPK occured 30 minutes after treatment with VEGFA165b [31]. For AKT, the difference in ED50 between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b was not as large as seen for MAPK, just two-fold greater for VEGFA165b compared to VEGFA165a. However, the activation of AKT by VEGFA165b was subtanially less than from VEGFA165a over the entire dose-response range. In contrast to MAPK activation, the time to maximum activation of AKT was earlier with VEGFA165b (15 minutes) compared to the VEGFA165a (30 minutes). While the differences in ED50 values were not as large as seen for MAPK activation, the maximum activation of AKT obtained with VEGFA165b was only 50% of the maximum activation generated by VEGFA165a. This was another difference from that reported in a non-retinal endothelial celltype, human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPECs), whereAKT activation is the same for VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b at a dose of 20 ng/ml (1000pM) in HPECs [48]. The differences noted above in the activation of MAPK and AKT between HRMECs and non-retinal endothelial cells suggest that VEGF-mediated intracellular signaling patterns are not completely universal between endothelial cells from different organs. An evaluation of primary endothelial cells from the human retina should be utilized whenever possible to study the retinal context. Altogether, our dose-response curves for the activation of VEGFR2, MAPK, and AKT in primary HRMECs were consistent with the model proposed by Whitaker et al. (2001), wherein VEGFA165a activates VEGFR2 more intensely when it can bind the co-receptor Neuropilin-1, to form a larger activation complex [49]. Based on the primary HRMEC dose-response data for MAPK activation, VEGFA165a was more potent for activating intracellular signalling than VEGFA165b at lower doses, which fall into a range of total VEGFA165a concentrations previously reported in human vitreous. Vitreous concentrations for VEGFA have been measured by various techniques in several disease conditions. Most elevated VEGFA is the VEGFA165 isoform, which diffuses slowly, and the vitreous has protease activity, therefore it is possible that the concentrations measured in the vitreous are somewhat lower than in the neural retina itself. With that stated, vitreal concentrations of 25 pM to over 400 pM have been reported for proliferative diabetic retinopathy from several studies [1,50–54]. Other studies have reported 10 pM in diabetic macular edema [55], 100 to 450 pM in retinopathy of prematurity [34,56] and an average of 430 pM, with as high as 580 pM, in central retinal vein occlusion [57]. It is possible that elevations of retinal VEGFA165a concentration to several-hundred pico-Molar could increase the activation of endothelial intracellular signalling above its normal baseline. In contrast, the much lower activation potential of VEGFA165b in this concentration range would leave MAPK activation close to normal if most of the VEGFA165 existed as the b-isoform. We also found that VEGFA165b could affect the expression of the same target genes that are also regulated by VEGFA165a in primary HRMECs. These included genes involved in leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion and tight-junction formation. Even though the 5,000 pM dose of VEGFA165b could activate MAPK and AKT more strongly than the intermediate 1,000 pM dose, it is unlikely that the 5,000 pM concentration would be experienced in vivo. For that reason we suggest that the effects on gene expression at 1,000 pM were most informative. We found that the CLDN5 gene was particulary succeptible to repression by both isoforms of VEGFA165 compared to OCLN in this cell type. VEGFA-mediated activation of the VEGFR2 receptor is known to disrupt adherin-junctions and causes ß-Catenin mediated repression of Claudin-5 gene expression in endothelial cells [58]. For all three leukocyte docking protein genes (ICAM1, SELE, VCAM1), VEGFA165a increased their expression at the intermediate dose of 1000 pM where VEGFA165b had less effect. We concluded that there were significant dose-response differences in the regulation of VEGFA-target genes, with VEGFA165a proving to be the stronger affector of gene expression overall. Summary Our results indicated that differences in the last 6 amino acids between VEGFA165a and VEGFA165b have a significant affect on the relative activation of MAPK and AKT within primary HRMECs. VEGFA165a activated both pathways at lower concentrations where VEGF165b had little effect. The greater potential of VEGFA165a to affect HRMECs also extended to changes in the expression of genes required for leukocyte-docking and tight-junction structure. Large dose-response differences in activation of these pathways exist in ranges of elevated VEGFA165a concentrations that have been reported in the vitreous of diseased eyes. Key aspects of MAPK and AKT activation, such as timing and maximal activation, were different in HRMECs compared to those reported for some other non-retinal endothelial cell-types. These results would support the concept that specific blockade of VEGFA165a, or modulating the VEGFA165b / VEGFA165a ratio, could be useful thereapeutic strategies for retinal diseases involving elevated VEGFA concentration."

      'html' : "The delay between amputation and prosthesis fitting contributes to the high rate of prosthetic abandonment despite advances in technology. Three-dimensional (3D) printing has allowed for the rapid fabrication of prostheses. Allowing individuals with amputations to interact with a prosthesis shortly after their procedure may reduce rejection chances. The purpose of the current investigation is to compare functional outcomes and patient satisfaction between a standard transradial prosthesis fitted in a clinic with a 3D-printed prosthesis fitted remotely. The standard prosthesis featured a hook terminal device, while the 3D printed prosthesis’ terminal device was a functional hand. The main finding of this case study was that the use of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely resulted in better functional performance, but lower overall patient satisfaction than the standard arm prosthesis. Use of the 3D printed arm resulted in improved gross manual dexterity as measured by the Box and Block test. The 3D printed prosthesis also allowed improved performance in bimanual coordination. However, the standard-hook device scored higher in patient satisfaction survey results. The patient's concerns with the 3D printed prosthesis were the durability and effectiveness of the device. While durability and complex grip patterns remain a concern, the positive attributes of 3D printed prostheses include visual appeal, ease of donning, and customization of parameters to improve upper-limb symmetry offers a promising option to familiarize new amputee patients with the use of a prosthesis. Rapid manufacturing and remote fitting allows 3D printed devices to serve as postoperative transitional devices and may function as definitive devices with minimal loss of functionality if standard clinic-based prostheses are not available. The patient was a 59-year-old male with a traumatic transradial amputation of the dominant arm. A 3D printed transradial prosthesis was remotely fitted and manufactured using photogrammetry. Assessments were performed initially with the standard-hook prosthesis and then with the 3D printed device after a 5-week familiarization period. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Box and Block Test and Bimanual Coordination Tray Test. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using two self-reported questionnaires (the QUEST 2.0 and the modified OPUS).  By the year 2050, an estimated 3.6 million persons will be living with amputations within the United States [1]. In the fiscal year 2016, 22% (n\u2009=\u200920,158) of the veterans who received amputation care at Veterans Affairs medical facilities had experienced an upper-limb amputation [2]. Of those, 16% (n\u2009=\u20093225) had a major upper-limb amputation. Furthermore, according to the National Trauma Databank [3], 0.09% of persons hospitalized after trauma sustained a major upper-limb amputation. The most common upper-limb amputation seen in adults is at the transradial level [4]. Despite advances in upper-limb prostheses, there continues to have a high rate of user abandonment [4]. Up to 52% of upper-limb amputees rejected or abandoned their prosthesis [2]. Fitting a patient with a prosthesis within 4\xa0weeks after amputation will increase the likelihood of acceptance of the device [5]. This time is known as the 'golden period' of upper extremity prosthetic rehabilitation and may be the most vital factor in the patients' acceptance of the prosthesis [6]. During this period, contractures and muscle atrophy are common risk factors that can affect prosthesis use and overall function. Preserved range of motion and strengthening of the affected musculature is crucial in maintaining body symmetry, posture, and alignment of the upper quadrant to reduce overuse injuries [7]. The use of transitional prostheses decreases the burden on the contralateral limb, increases function by offering an additional grasp with bimanual tasks, assists in body symmetry, and improves self-image [8]. It has been reported that immediate postoperative prosthesis use (i.e., transitional prosthesis) can also improve the range of motion and strength of the affected limb [9]. However, these transitional devices are often made by hand, requiring long construction time and highly skilled technicians to manufacture them [9, 10]. The ability to develop low-cost, lightweight, customized and user-friendly upper-limb transitional prostheses designed to familiarize the transradial amputee patient with the use and function of different prostheses can have a significant impact in the reduction of prosthetic rejection of a definitive prosthesis [11]. Recent technological advances in computer-aided design programs and additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, offer the unique possibility of fitting, designing, and manufacturing low-cost and customized upper-limb 3D printed prostheses remotely [7, 12, 13]. While their rapid production and low cost has been documented and suggests 3D printed devices can serve as transitional devices, little literature has investigated their functionality compared to a common clinic-based prosthesis, the prosthetic hook (henceforth: standard prosthesis). Thus, the purpose of the current investigation is to compare functional outcomes and patient satisfaction between a standard transradial prosthesis fitted in a clinic with a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely. This information is crucial for the implementation of 3D printed prostheses as transitional prostheses, or definitive prostheses in areas without access to standard prostheses from a clinic. We hypothesized that there would be no significant differences for functional or patient satisfaction outcomes between a standard arm prosthesis and a 3D arm printed prosthesis. Our hypothesis is based on previous investigations that have described the functionality of 3D printed prostheses [14] and their potential use as transitional prostheses [7, 12].  Table 1 summarizes the functional assessments for the Box and Block Test (Fig.\xa01A, C) and the Bimanual Coordination Tray (Fig.\xa01B, D) for the first visit using the standard arm prosthesis and the second visit using the 3D printed arm prosthesis. The participant performed significantly better (Student’s t-test, p\u2009<\u20090.05) using the 3D printed arm prosthesis (17.0\u2009±\u20091.0) compared to the standard prosthesis (12.3\u2009±\u20091.2) in the Box and Block test. In terms of bimanual coordination, the participant displayed non-significant differences in overall temporal coordination between using the 3D printed or standard arm prostheses. However, there appears to be an observable but insignificant difference (Student’s t-test, p\u2009=\u20090.29) in hand-return coordination when using the standard prosthesis, compared to the 3D (Fig.\xa02). The QUEST questionnaire's descriptive information for the standard and 3D printed arm prostheses are summarized in Table 2. The OPUS satisfaction and functional items for the standard and 3D printed arm prostheses are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Functional testing. A Box and Block Test with the standard prosthesis and the 3D printed arm prosthesis, respectively. B Bimanual Coordination Tray Test with the standard prosthesis and the 3D printed arm prosthesis, respectively. The functional testing was performed after using each prosthesis for 4\xa0weeks. C Bimanual coordination with the standard prosthesis. D Bimanual coordination with the 3D printed arm prosthesis The bimanual task required the participant to grasp and transport a tray to assess synchrony of the upper limbs during a functional reach-to-grasp bimanual task. Use of the standard prosthesis during the task (A), the participant displayed an observable but statistically insignificant (Student’s t-test, p\u2009=\u20090.29) asynchrony while returning his hands to the starting position using the standard prosthesis. This trend of asynchrony was not observed during the use of the 3D printed arm (B) The self-reported surveys, however, indicated that overall the research participant seemed more satisfied with the standard arm prosthesis than the 3D printed arm. The 3D printed prosthesis was superior for items related to the prosthesis dimensions (such as size and manageable weight; Tables 2, 3), ease of donning and doffing, and esthetics of the device (Table 3). The surveys showed that the research participant had a consistent concern with the durability of the 3D printed arm (Tables 2, 3), although no failures were reported. In terms of reported function, both prostheses allowed the research participant to perform activities that use gross or composite grasping, such as drinking from a paper cup (Table 4). However, for activities that require individual finger movement or different grasping patterns (i.e., dial a touch-tone phone and use a spoon or fork; Table 4), the standard prosthesis performed better than the 3D printed arm. The patient reported that their concerns of durability with the 3D printed prosthesis paired with the increased dexterity of the standard prosthesis lead to the overall decreased use of the 3D printed prosthesis.  Only a few studies have compared standard prostheses versus 3D printed arm prostheses. Previous case studies have compared standard myoelectric arm [23] or partial hand prostheses [24] with comparable 3D printed prostheses. Lee et al. [23], compared a standard myoelectric and 3D printed pressure sensor-controlled arm prostheses in a 52-year-old male patient with a transradial traumatic amputation. In agreement with the results of the present study, the authors found increased functional performance in the Box and Block test and nine hole pegboard test using the 3D printed prosthesis. Both prostheses allowed the participant to perform activities that use gross or composite grasping, such as transferring a paper cup and putting on socks. However, for activities that require high dexterity (i.e., individual finger movement) and grip strength, the standard myoelectric prosthesis resulted in higher performance. Baun et al. [24], compared a standard myoelectric partial hand prosthesis with a body-powered 3D printed partial hand prosthesis in a 48-year-old male with partial hand amputation of the non-dominant left hand. The authors [24] reported lower performance for the 3D printed partial hand prosthesis when compared to the myoelectric prosthesis in the Southampton Hand Assessment Protocol and a lower rating in a semi-structured interview. However, the 3D printed prosthesis performed comparably to the myoelectric prosthetic in grasping large lightweight objects and performed slightly higher in a single trial of the box and blocks test. Although the comparison of a myoelectric versus body-powered partial hand prostheses [24] may lack validity, the study provides valuable information related to functional outcomes. The potential limitations of the present investigation include learning effects, differences in device functionality and design, and conflicting survey scores. Box and blocks and bimanual coordination trials were not randomized and thus did not account for the subject learning the procedure over time. These learning effects are likely insignificant due to the limited number of trials; however, it would be unreasonable not to account for this limitation in the future to eliminate it. Stark differences in the actuation of the prosthetics created a limitation in comparative analysis. For example, a prosthetic hook's terminal device is actuated by shoulder movement. Meanwhile, pinching and grasping actions in the 3D printed prosthetic device were actuated by flexion of the elbow. Differences in terminal devices may have also impacted the comparison of functionality; the 3D device's hand versus the standard device's hook differ significantly in gripping power and versatility. Moreover, the standard prosthesis allowed for passive gripping force, as it was a voluntary-opening device. Lastly, there were conflicting results in the QUEST and OPUS survey. The durability of the 3D printed device received a 2 in the QUEST (Table 2), while durability received a 4 in the OPUS (Table 3). This could be due to the subject submitting these ratings at different times or recalling different experiences during time of submission. Additionally, user effectiveness ratings in the QUEST reported that the standard device exhibited superior performance with a rating of a 5 (very satisfied) compared to 3D printed device's rating of a 2 (not very satisfied). Similar results were reported in the OPUS survey of functional performance. Overall, the findings from previous investigations [23, 24] and the current case study may suggest that 3D printed prostheses are equal or superior to standard prosthesis in functional activities that include gross or composite grasping, and less functional in activities that require individual finger movement, different grasping patterns, and strong gripping. Furthermore, the perceived low durability of 3D printed prostheses represents a constant concern [7, 12]. The limited grip strength could be ameliorated with the use of hybrid 3D printed prostheses which could use linear actuators that drive finger flexion and increase grasp strength in individuals with shorter residual limbs. While the 3D printed functional hands are limited in terms of grasping patterns and individual finger movement, future designs could implement more advanced terminal devices that allow for complex finger movement and varied grasping patterns, while maintaining the low-cost 3D printed proximal portion of the prosthesis. Additionally, the 3D printed transradial prosthesis requires a residual limb of at least 3–4\xa0cm in length to appropriately flex the elbow and articulate the fingers. Individuals with shorter residual limbs can be fitted with additional thermal plastic around their limb that inserts to the 3D printed socket to allow for a longer lever arm. Nonetheless, the main advantage of a 3D printed prosthesis is the visual appeal of the device, rapid and cost-effective manufacturing method, and the ability to fit these devices remotely [7, 12]. The ability to fit a 3D printed arm prosthesis remotely has the potential of making transitional or postoperative prosthesis accessible to a large number of individuals in rural or isolated areas. Health care professionals from developed countries could remotely fit and manufacture transitional prostheses and send them to the medical team supervising the patient [7].  The use of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely resulted in better functional performance, but lower overall patient satisfaction than the standard arm prosthesis. The durability concerns and the lack of individual finger movement represent a major limitation of 3D printed prostheses. However, the positive attributes of these devices, including visual appeal, easiness to put on, reduced weight, and customization of dimensional parameters to improve upper-limb symmetry, offer promising options.  This case report describes the functional and patient satisfaction outcomes of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely versus a standard arm prosthesis. Furthermore, this case report also describes the process of designing, fitting, and manufacturing a 3D printed arm prosthesis. The patient was a 59-year-old male (height: 177.8\xa0cm and weight: 81.6\xa0kg) with a traumatic transradial amputation of the dominant arm (Fig.\xa01A). The residual forearm was 21\xa0cm in length and 24.5\xa0cm in circumference. The non-affected forearm was 28\xa0cm in length and 28\xa0cm in circumference. The research participant was informed about the study, and a consent form was explained and signed. The study was approved by the University of Nebraska Medical Center Institutional Review Board. The patient visited the laboratory on two occasions. During the first visit, the patient used the standard prosthesis and hook attachment to perform the Box and Block Test to assess unimanual gross dexterity [15] and a bimanual coordination tray to assess hand synchrony. The Box and Block Test was performed using methods previously described by Mathiowetz et al. [16]. In short, the participant was asked to sit comfortably in front of a partitioned box (53.7\xa0cm\u2009×\u200925.4\xa0cm, 8.5\xa0cm), with his hands at the sides of the box. When instructed to begin, the participant moved as many 2.5\u2009×\u20092.5\u2009×\u20092.5\xa0cm blocks from one partition to the other within one minute, only moving one block at a time. Three trials were performed per hand, for a total of six trials during each visit. The bimanual task was recorded using an experimental instrument previously described by Kilbreath et al. [17], examining inter-limb coordination in individuals who survived strokes. The bimanual coordination tray required the participant to rest his hands on the instrumented box, shoulder width apart, with his back to the chair. Both wrists were fitted with magnetic straps, which triggered electromagnetic sensors in the box, as well as the trays that are lifted during the tasks. The participant was asked to reach forward and grab both trays (hand-to-tray) and transport them 110\xa0mm forward and 8\xa0mm upward to the ledge on the box (tray transport). Finally, they were to return their hands to the starting position (hand return) [17]. This task was performed for three trials each visit. The patient reported using the standard prosthesis for four to five hours a day for 5\xa0weeks before his first laboratory visit. Measurements were verified during the second visit and the 3D printed device was shipped to the participant in 2\xa0days. During the second visit, the patient used a 3D printed arm prosthesis (Fig.\xa03B, C) and performed the same testing described in the first visit. The patient reported using the 3D printed arm prosthesis 6\xa0h per week for 5\xa0weeks before his second laboratory visit. The patient completed functional and satisfaction surveys after using each prosthesis. Prosthesis use and satisfaction were assessed using the Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with assistive Technology (QUEST 2.0) [218] and a modified version of the Orthotics Prosthetics Users Survey (OPUS) [19, 20]. The QUEST 2.0 is a 12-item measure that assesses user satisfaction with the device and service provided, and has shown to be a validate and reliable measure in other populations such as multiple sclerosis [21]. The Modified OPUS [20] is a validated instrument to specifically measure prosthetic and orthotic device outcomes. We specifically administered the upper extremity functional status survey (UEFS), as well as the OPUS Satisfaction with Devices (CSD) and Satisfaction with Services (CSS).

C Finger flexion was activated through 10°–20° of elbow flexion of the residual functional joint in the direction of the red arrow. The wrist can be manually adjusted The 3D printed arm prosthesis was a voluntary-closing prosthesis powered by elbow flexion (Fig.\xa03B, C). The device was secured using a Velcro strap in the arm cuff of the 3D printed prosthesis, so no harness was required to suspend this device. Using the BOA closure system (Mid power reel M3, BOA Technology Inc., Denver, Colorado), the patient can rotate the dial on the proximal portion of the prosthesis (Fig.\xa03C, see “tensioner”) to increase the tension on the flexion cables that run through the forearm and to the phalanges of the prosthesis. This allows for incremental levels of elbow flexion necessary to close the hand. Magnets embedded into the wrist joint of the 3D printed arm prosthesis allowed passive adjustments of wrist rotation. Cable entanglement was prevented by a pivot system connecting the hand and the arm cables at the wrist. The hand allowed composite phalangeal flexion and index–thumb pinch grasping actions that were actuated by the elbow's flexion. Elbow flexion of 10° would produce 2.5\xa0cm of cable travel for full operation. Silicone finger grips were added onto the fingertips to increase friction and prevent slippage of gripped objects. The prosthesis was designed to be proportional to the length and circumference of the participant's non-affected limb. Scaling the prosthesis was performed remotely and began with instructing a family member to photograph both the affected and unaffected limbs, including a known measurable scale, such as a ruler (Fig.\xa03A). This photo was then uploaded to Autodesk Fusion 360 and used as a backdrop. Using the ruler included in the photograph, Autodesk Fusion 360 was calibrated by informing the software the distance between two centimeter hatch marks on the ruler. This photogrammetric method allowed the extraction of several anthropometric measurements from the photographs. The measurements collected were: residual limb length and width, the non-affected limb’s forearm length and width, hand length and width, as well as finger length. Circumferences of the residual limb were estimated based on width measured. Once the prosthesis was scaled to the patient's arm and measurements were confirmed by a certified prosthetist, the files were uploaded to the 3D printer. The prosthesis was manufactured using polylactic acid. Polylactic acid was chosen as it is a low-cost material that is biodegradable and possesses thermoforming characteristics that facilitate post-processing and final adjustments. The average printing time is between 8 and 10\xa0h using an Ultimaker 2 Extended (Ultimaker 2, Ultimaker B.V., Geldermalsen, The Netherlands). The 3D printed arm took 2\xa0days to construct and 2\xa0days for shipping. The standard arm prosthesis consisted of a socket made of flexible material, a hook terminal device, a wrist unit to enable rotation of the hook, a Bowden control-cable system, and a figure-9-harness that supports the prosthesis. The prosthetic hook was a voluntary-opening device primarily controlled by flexion of the glenohumeral joint for grasping objects distant from the midline of the body (i.e., forward-reaching) and biscapular abduction to grasp objects close to the midline of the body (i.e., buttoning a shirt). The standard voluntary-opening hook required 5\xa0cm of cable travel for full operation. The standard arm prosthesis was fitted in a clinic by a certified prosthetist. The average time of prosthetic fitting after amputation is roughly 12.7\xa0months [22]. Specifically, our participant did not receive his hook prosthesis until 12\xa0months after his amputation. This further highlights the expedience of the 3D printed device fitment and manufacturing, which may reduce prosthetic rejection [5, 22].",
      'pages' : ["The delay between amputation and prosthesis fitting contributes to the high rate of prosthetic abandonment despite advances in technology. Three-dimensional (3D) printing has allowed for the rapid fabrication of prostheses. Allowing individuals with amputations to interact with a prosthesis shortly after their procedure may reduce rejection chances. The purpose of the current investigation is to compare functional outcomes and patient satisfaction between a standard transradial prosthesis fitted in a clinic with a 3D-printed prosthesis fitted remotely. The standard prosthesis featured a hook terminal device, while the 3D printed prosthesis’ terminal device was a functional hand. The main finding of this case study was that the use of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely resulted in better functional performance, but lower overall patient satisfaction than the standard arm prosthesis. Use of the 3D printed arm resulted in improved gross manual dexterity as measured by the Box and Block test. The 3D printed prosthesis also allowed improved performance in bimanual coordination. However, the standard-hook device scored higher in patient satisfaction survey results. The patient's concerns with the 3D printed prosthesis were the durability and effectiveness of the device. While durability and complex grip patterns remain a concern, the positive attributes of 3D printed prostheses include visual appeal, ease of donning, and customization of parameters to improve upper-limb symmetry offers a promising option to familiarize new amputee patients with the use of a prosthesis. Rapid manufacturing and remote fitting allows 3D printed devices to serve as postoperative transitional devices and may function as definitive devices with minimal loss of functionality if standard clinic-based prostheses are not available. The patient was a 59-year-old male with a traumatic transradial amputation of the dominant arm. A 3D printed transradial prosthesis was remotely fitted and manufactured using photogrammetry. Assessments were performed initially with the standard-hook prosthesis and then with the 3D printed device after a 5-week familiarization period. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Box and Block Test and", 
                 "Bimanual Coordination Tray Test. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using two self-reported questionnaires (the QUEST 2.0 and the modified OPUS).  By the year 2050, an estimated 3.6 million persons will be living with amputations within the United States [1]. In the fiscal year 2016, 22% (n\u2009=\u200920,158) of the veterans who received amputation care at Veterans Affairs medical facilities had experienced an upper-limb amputation [2]. Of those, 16% (n\u2009=\u20093225) had a major upper-limb amputation. Furthermore, according to the National Trauma Databank [3], 0.09% of persons hospitalized after trauma sustained a major upper-limb amputation. The most common upper-limb amputation seen in adults is at the transradial level [4]. Despite advances in upper-limb prostheses, there continues to have a high rate of user abandonment [4]. Up to 52% of upper-limb amputees rejected or abandoned their prosthesis [2]. Fitting a patient with a prosthesis within 4\xa0weeks after amputation will increase the likelihood of acceptance of the device [5]. This time is known as the 'golden period' of upper extremity prosthetic rehabilitation and may be the most vital factor in the patients' acceptance of the prosthesis [6]. During this period, contractures and muscle atrophy are common risk factors that can affect prosthesis use and overall function. Preserved range of motion and strengthening of the affected musculature is crucial in maintaining body symmetry, posture, and alignment of the upper quadrant to reduce overuse injuries [7]. The use of transitional prostheses decreases the burden on the contralateral limb, increases function by offering an additional grasp with bimanual tasks, assists in body symmetry, and improves self-image [8]. It has been reported that immediate postoperative prosthesis use (i.e., transitional prosthesis) can also improve the range of motion and strength of the affected limb [9]. However, these transitional devices are often made by hand, requiring long construction time and highly skilled technicians to manufacture them [9, 10]. The ability to develop low-cost, lightweight, customized and user-friendly upper-limb transitional prostheses designed to familiarize the transradial amputee patient with the use and function of different prostheses can have a significant impact in the reduction of prosthetic rejection of a definitive prosthesis [11]. Recent technological advances in computer-aided design programs and additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, offer the unique possibility of fitting, designing, and manufacturing low-cost and customized upper-limb 3D printed prostheses remotely [7, 12, 13]. While their rapid production and low cost has been documented and suggests 3D printed devices can serve as transitional devices, little literature has investigated their functionality compared to a common clinic-based prosthesis, the prosthetic hook (henceforth: standard prosthesis). Thus, the purpose of the current investigation is to compare functional outcomes and patient satisfaction between a standard transradial prosthesis fitted in a clinic with a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely. This information is crucial for the implementation of 3D printed prostheses as transitional prostheses, or definitive prostheses in areas without access to standard prostheses from a clinic. We hypothesized that there would be no significant differences for functional or",
                 "patient satisfaction outcomes between a standard arm prosthesis and a 3D arm printed prosthesis. Our hypothesis is based on previous investigations that have described the functionality of 3D printed prostheses [14] and their potential use as transitional prostheses [7, 12].  Table 1 summarizes the functional assessments for the Box and Block Test (Fig.\xa01A, C) and the Bimanual Coordination Tray (Fig.\xa01B, D) for the first visit using the standard arm prosthesis and the second visit using the 3D printed arm prosthesis. The participant performed significantly better (Student’s t-test, p\u2009<\u20090.05) using the 3D printed arm prosthesis (17.0\u2009±\u20091.0) compared to the standard prosthesis (12.3\u2009±\u20091.2) in the Box and Block test. In terms of bimanual coordination, the participant displayed non-significant differences in overall temporal coordination between using the 3D printed or standard arm prostheses. However, there appears to be an observable but insignificant difference (Student’s t-test, p\u2009=\u20090.29) in hand-return coordination when using the standard prosthesis, compared to the 3D (Fig.\xa02). The QUEST questionnaire's descriptive information for the standard and 3D printed arm prostheses are summarized in Table 2. The OPUS satisfaction and functional items for the standard and 3D printed arm prostheses are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Functional testing. A Box and Block Test with the standard prosthesis and the 3D printed arm prosthesis, respectively. B Bimanual Coordination Tray Test with the standard prosthesis and the 3D printed arm prosthesis, respectively. The functional testing was performed after using each prosthesis for 4\xa0weeks. C Bimanual coordination with the standard prosthesis. D Bimanual coordination with the 3D printed arm prosthesis The bimanual task required the participant to grasp and transport a tray to assess synchrony of the upper limbs during a functional reach-to-grasp bimanual task. Use of the standard prosthesis during the task (A), the participant displayed an observable but statistically insignificant (Student’s t-test, p\u2009=\u20090.29) asynchrony while returning his hands to the starting position using the standard prosthesis. This trend of asynchrony was not observed during the use of the 3D printed arm (B) The self-reported surveys, however, indicated that overall the research participant seemed more satisfied with the standard arm prosthesis than the 3D printed arm. The 3D printed prosthesis was superior for items related to the prosthesis dimensions (such as size and manageable weight; Tables 2, 3), ease of donning and doffing, and esthetics of the device (Table 3). The surveys showed that the research participant had a consistent concern with the durability of the 3D printed arm (Tables 2, 3), although no failures were reported. In terms of reported function, both prostheses allowed the research participant to perform activities that use gross or composite grasping, such as drinking from a paper cup (Table 4). However, for activities that require individual finger movement or different grasping patterns (i.e., dial a touch-tone phone and use a spoon or fork; Table 4), the standard prosthesis performed better than the 3D printed arm. The patient reported that their concerns of durability with the 3D printed prosthesis paired with the increased dexterity of the standard prosthesis lead to the overall decreased use of the 3D printed prosthesis.",
                 "Only a few studies have compared standard prostheses versus 3D printed arm prostheses. Previous case studies have compared standard myoelectric arm [23] or partial hand prostheses [24] with comparable 3D printed prostheses. Lee et al. [23], compared a standard myoelectric and 3D printed pressure sensor-controlled arm prostheses in a 52-year-old male patient with a transradial traumatic amputation. In agreement with the results of the present study, the authors found increased functional performance in the Box and Block test and nine hole pegboard test using the 3D printed prosthesis. Both prostheses allowed the participant to perform activities that use gross or composite grasping, such as transferring a paper cup and putting on socks. However, for activities that require high dexterity (i.e., individual finger movement) and grip strength, the standard myoelectric prosthesis resulted in higher performance. Baun et al. [24], compared a standard myoelectric partial hand prosthesis with a body-powered 3D printed partial hand prosthesis in a 48-year-old male with partial hand amputation of the non-dominant left hand. The authors [24] reported lower performance for the 3D printed partial hand prosthesis when compared to the myoelectric prosthesis in the Southampton Hand Assessment Protocol and a lower rating in a semi-structured interview. However, the 3D printed prosthesis performed comparably to the myoelectric prosthetic in", 
                 "grasping large lightweight objects and performed slightly higher in a single trial of the box and blocks test. Although the comparison of a myoelectric versus body-powered partial hand prostheses [24] may lack validity, the study provides valuable information related to functional outcomes. The potential limitations of the present investigation include learning effects, differences in device functionality and design, and conflicting survey scores. Box and blocks and bimanual coordination trials were not randomized and thus did not account for the subject learning the procedure over time. These learning effects are likely insignificant due to the limited number of trials; however, it would be unreasonable not to account for this limitation in the future to eliminate it. Stark differences in the actuation of the prosthetics created a limitation in comparative analysis. For example, a prosthetic hook's terminal device is actuated by shoulder movement. Meanwhile, pinching and grasping actions in the 3D printed prosthetic device were actuated by flexion of the elbow. Differences in terminal devices may have also impacted the comparison of functionality;", 
                 "",
                 "the 3D device's hand versus the standard device's hook differ significantly in gripping power and versatility. Moreover, the standard prosthesis allowed for passive gripping force, as it was a voluntary-opening device. Lastly, there were conflicting results in the QUEST and OPUS survey. The durability of the 3D printed device received a 2 in the QUEST (Table 2), while durability received a 4 in the OPUS (Table 3). This could be due to the subject submitting these ratings at different times or recalling different experiences during time of submission. Additionally, user effectiveness ratings in the QUEST reported that the standard device exhibited superior performance with a rating of a 5", 
                 "(very satisfied) compared to 3D printed device's rating of a 2 (not very satisfied). Similar results were reported in the OPUS survey of functional performance. Overall, the findings from previous investigations [23, 24] and the current case study may suggest that 3D printed prostheses are equal or superior to standard prosthesis in functional activities that include gross or composite grasping, and less functional in activities that require individual finger movement, different grasping patterns, and strong gripping. Furthermore, the perceived low durability of 3D printed prostheses represents a constant concern [7, 12]. The limited grip strength could be ameliorated with the use of hybrid 3D printed prostheses which could use linear actuators that drive finger flexion and increase grasp strength in individuals with shorter residual limbs. While the 3D printed functional hands are limited in terms of grasping patterns and individual finger movement, future designs could implement more advanced terminal devices that allow for complex finger movement and varied grasping patterns, while maintaining the low-cost 3D printed proximal portion of the prosthesis. Additionally, the 3D printed transradial prosthesis requires a residual limb of at least 3–4\xa0cm in length to appropriately flex the elbow and articulate the fingers. Individuals with shorter residual limbs can be fitted with additional thermal plastic around their limb that inserts to the 3D printed socket to allow for a longer lever arm. Nonetheless, the main advantage of a 3D printed prosthesis is the visual appeal of the device, rapid and cost-effective manufacturing method, and the ability to fit these devices remotely [7, 12]. The ability to fit a 3D printed arm prosthesis remotely has the potential of making transitional or postoperative prosthesis accessible to a large number of individuals in rural or isolated areas. Health care professionals from developed countries could remotely fit and manufacture transitional prostheses and send them to the medical team supervising the patient [7].  The use of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely resulted in better functional performance, but lower overall patient satisfaction than the standard arm prosthesis. The durability concerns and the lack of individual finger movement represent a major limitation of 3D printed prostheses. However, the positive attributes of these devices, including visual appeal, easiness to put on, reduced weight, and customization of dimensional parameters to improve upper-limb symmetry, offer promising options.  This case report describes the functional and patient satisfaction outcomes of a 3D printed arm prosthesis fitted remotely versus a standard arm prosthesis. Furthermore, this case report also describes the process of designing, fitting, and manufacturing a 3D printed arm prosthesis. The patient was a 59-year-old male (height: 177.8\xa0cm and weight: 81.6\xa0kg) with a traumatic transradial amputation of the dominant arm (Fig.\xa01A).

      'html' : 'The decreasing fossil resources, increasing demand, and rising prices for energy, as well as the growing CO2 emissions caused by the massive consumption of fossil fuels, have stimulated research into the production of platform chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass resources, especially waste biomass [1,2,3]. Anaerobic digestion is a promising process for the conversion of biomass to renewable energy; and research in this field mainly focuses on determining the ideal conditions for diverse substrates such as agro-industrial wastes [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Anaerobic digestion involves four steps: (1) the breakdown of organic compounds into soluble oligomers; (2) further hydrolysis and fermentation to produce mainly organic acids (acidogenesis); (3) acetate production (acetogenesis); and finally, (4) methane and carbon dioxide production (methanogenesis), which is the most energy and time-consuming step [10,11]. Organic acids such as acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acid, produced during the acidogenesis step, may be used among other applications for the production of ester-based fuels similar to biodiesel. This approach has been previously proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative [6,7,8,9,12,13]; however, further research is needed on efficient and cost-effective esterification, separation, and purification processes. Mixed anaerobic bacteria culture obtained from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor [6,7,12], treating molasses, was used to inoculate the growth medium containing: 50 g/L cellobiose, aqueous solution of NH3, and 50% H3PO4 (COD:N:P ratio of 100:5:1), 4 g/L NaHCO3, and 4 g/L yeast extract, without pH adjustment [24]. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Cell growth was carried out at 37 °C overnight. Mixed anaerobic bacteria culture obtained from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor [6,7,12], treating molasses, was used to inoculate the growth medium containing: 50 g/L cellobiose, aqueous solution of NH3, and 50% H3PO4 (COD:N:P ratio of 100:5:1), 4 g/L NaHCO3, and 4 g/L yeast extract, without pH adjustment [24]. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Cell growth was carried out at 37 °C overnight. Cell immobilization was carried out in conical flasks containing 50 g of γ-alumina pellets and a 70-mL growth medium. The γ-alumina pellets, which were used in this study, are characterized by an average length of 5.2 mm, surface area of 290 m2/g, and an average pore diameter of 7.8 nm. The system was left to ferment at 37 °C for 48 h without feeding in order to achieve immobilization of the cells on the biomass carriers [8]. Subsequently, the growth medium was decanted and a fresh synthetic medium was added for anaerobic fermentation experiments, which contained: cellobiose 30–70 g/L, the aqueous solution of NH3, and 50% H3PO4 (COD:N:P ratio of 100:5:1), 4 g/L of NaHCO3, and 4 g/L of yeast extract. The pH was adjusted with 0.5 N of HCl to values from 5 to 9, as slightly acidic pH values promote hydrolysis, while a pH less than 5 is usually inhibitory for the anaerobic culture. Alkaline pH values until 8–10 have also proved to be beneficial due to increased buffering capacity and methanogenesis inhibition [28]. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Fermentation experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (27, 37, and 47 °C) for 48 h. The tested temperatures belong to the mesophilic range, which is mainly chosen for VFAs production as high efficiency of the process has been observed [28]. The experimental procedure is presented in detail in Figure 1. After freeze-drying for 48 h, the samples of immobilized anaerobic mixed culture cells on γ-alumina were coated with gold (Blazers SCD 004 Sputter Coater) for 3 min to increase the electrical conductivity. Subsequently, scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL model JSM-6300) imaging followed. The produced organic acids were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), on a Jasco LC-2000 Plus chromatograph (Jasco Inc., Tokyo, Japan), equipped with a Bio-rad Aminex HPX-87H column (300 × 7.8 mm, 9 μm particle size), a CO-2060 Plus column oven, an AS-2050 autosampler, a PU-2089 quaternary gradient pump, and an MD-2018 photodiode array detector. Isocratic separation at 50 °C with 0.008 N of H2SO4 and a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min were performed, and all the data were processed with the ChromNav software (Jasco, 2010, Tokyo, Japan). The samples were filtered with a disposable cellulose acetate syringe filter (CHROMAFIL) of a 0.20-μm pore size. All determinations were performed by means of standard curves. The production of organic acids was calculated as a function of the levels of the three independent variables (temperature, initial pH value, and cellobiose concentration) with a significant influence on the response variables. Each parameter had three levels: the maximum value (+1), the minimum (−1), and the center point (0), as shown in Table 1. SEM images (Figure 2) were used in order to observe and evaluate the immobilization of the mixed anaerobic culture cells on the γ-alumina pellets. Elsewhere, γ-Alumina has been tested successfully for the immobilization of pure cultures, providing higher efficiency of the process as the concentration of the final product increased significantly [6,7,12,13]. The cells’ immobilization is probably performed by their attachment on the γ-alumina surface due to the electrostatic interactions between the cell membrane and the vector surface. As γ-alumina is classified as a porous material, cells entrapment is favored, thus providing a large surface area for cells and medium interaction [29,30]. The images in Figure 2 confirm the immobilization of the cells on the entire surface of γ-alumina. Successful immobilization is considered of great importance in order to achieve a robust system [30] and, more specifically, a stable biocatalyst, which usually leads to significantly decreased fermentation time requirements, increased process efficiency, and functionality.

The goodness of fit of the regression equation was evaluated by the determination coefficient (R2). The value of determination R2 (0.98) indicates that the response model could explain 98% of the total variations. The value of the adjusted determination coefficient (RAdj2 = 0.97) was high enough to indicate the significance of the model. According to the ANOVA of the regression model, the F-test for the regression was significant at a level of 5% (p < 0.05). The coefficients of the regression equation were calculated and the following regression equation was obtained: Organic acids (g/L) = −84.30 + 3.36 X1 + 8.16X2 + 0.30X3 − 0.045X12 − 0.58X22 − 2.52E − 003X32 + 1.62E − 003X1X2 − 2.5E − 004X1X3 + 1E − 003X2X3. (2) The use of an experimental design with the main aim to reveal the influence of fermentation conditions allowed the rapid screening of a large experimental domain in search of a prediction model for organic acids production by the anaerobic acidogenic fermentation of cellobiose. Cellobiose was used as a model substrate for further experiments with delignified straw or another cellulosic biomass. The results of five repeated experiments at a defined set of factor values corroborated the validity of the model, while the latter can be considered reliable for predicting the production of organic acids. According to the analysis, maximization of the organic acid production can be obtained at 37.27 °C, pH 7.04, and 60.34 g/L cellobiose, while for a cost-effective operation the parameters could be adjusted at 36.10 °C, pH 8.57, and 3.26% (32.6 g/L), resulting in a mean value of organic acid production of 7.89 g/L.',

          "The decreasing fossil resources, increasing demand, and rising prices for energy, as well as the growing CO2 emissions caused by the massive consumption of fossil fuels, have stimulated research into the production of platform chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass resources, especially waste biomass [1,2,3]. Anaerobic digestion is a promising process for the conversion of biomass to renewable energy; and research in this field mainly focuses on determining the ideal conditions for diverse substrates such as agro-industrial wastes [4,5,6,7,8,9]. Anaerobic digestion involves four steps: (1) the breakdown of organic compounds into soluble oligomers; (2) further hydrolysis and fermentation to produce mainly organic acids (acidogenesis); (3) acetate production (acetogenesis); and finally, (4) methane and carbon dioxide production (methanogenesis), which is the most energy and time-consuming step [10,11]. Organic acids such as acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acid, produced during the acidogenesis step, may be used among other applications for the production of ester-based fuels similar to biodiesel. This approach has been previously proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative [6,7,8,9,12,13]; however, further research is needed on efficient and cost-effective esterification, separation, and purification processes.", "Mixed anaerobic bacteria culture obtained from an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor [6,7,12], treating molasses, was used to inoculate the growth medium containing: 50 g/L cellobiose, aqueous solution of NH3, and 50% H3PO4 (COD:N:P ratio of 100:5:1), 4 g/L NaHCO3, and 4 g/L yeast extract, without pH adjustment [24]. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Cell growth was carried out at 37 °C overnight.",
          "Cell immobilization was carried out in conical flasks containing 50 g of γ-alumina pellets and a 70-mL growth medium. The γ-alumina pellets, which were used in this study, are characterized by an average length of 5.2 mm, surface area of 290 m2/g, and an average pore diameter of 7.8 nm. The system was left to ferment at 37 °C for 48 h without feeding in order to achieve immobilization of the cells on the biomass carriers [8]. Subsequently, the growth medium was decanted and a fresh synthetic medium was added for anaerobic fermentation experiments, which contained: cellobiose 30–70 g/L, the aqueous solution of NH3, and 50% H3PO4 (COD:N:P ratio of 100:5:1), 4 g/L of NaHCO3, and 4 g/L of yeast extract. The pH was adjusted with 0.5 N of HCl to values from 5 to 9, as slightly acidic pH values promote hydrolysis, while a pH less than 5 is usually inhibitory for the anaerobic culture. Alkaline pH values until 8–10 have also proved to be beneficial due to increased buffering capacity and methanogenesis inhibition [28]. The medium was sterilized by autoclaving at 120 °C for 15 min. Fermentation experiments were carried out at three different temperatures (27, 37, and 47 °C) for 48 h. The tested temperatures belong to the mesophilic range, which is mainly chosen for VFAs production as high efficiency of the process has been observed [28].
